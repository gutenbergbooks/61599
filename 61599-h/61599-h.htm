<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This record of a time spent among the less well-known portions of Malaysia may be
interesting to those whom the goddess of travel has wooed in vain, as perchance to
some of those &#x201c;birds of passage&#x201d; to whom the islands and continents of the world are
as well known as the church-spires and mile-stones of their own land. In the islands
of the Malay archipelago&#x2014;the Gardens of the Sun&#x2014;Nature is ever beautiful, and man,
although often strikingly primitive, is hospitable to the stranger, and not often
vile.
</p>
<p>A voyage of a few weeks brings us to these beauty-spots of the Eastern Seas&#x2014;to an
&#x201c;always-afternoon&#x201d; kind of climate&#x2014;since they are blessed with the heat and glory
of eternal summer&#x2014;to a place where winter is unknown&#x2014;monsoon-swept islands oasis-like
basking in a warm and shallow desert of sea. Warmed by perpetual sunshine, deluged
by copious rains, and thrilled by electricity, they are really enormous conservatories
of beautiful vegetation&#x2014;great Zoological Gardens inhabited by rare birds and curious
animals. In these sunny garden scenes man is the Adam of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e182" href="#xd29e182">viii</a>]</span>modern Eden, primitive in habits and numerically insignificant; he has scarcely begun
his battle with things inanimate, or his struggle for existence as it is known to
us. At home we have man as in some sort the master of Nature, but in the Bornean forests
Nature still reigns supreme. Here with us man wrests his sustenance from her&#x2014;there
she is lavish in the bestowal of gifts unsought.
</p>
<p>The immediate future of an island larger in area than Great Britain cannot fail to
be of interest to political thinkers, especially to those who belong to the &#x201c;scientific
frontier&#x201d; school. Malay Government is weaker now than it was even at the time Sir
James Brooke received Sarawak, and the aid of our own Government is now being sought
in favour of the cession of the whole of Northern Borneo&#x2014;from Gaya Bay to Sabuco&#x2014;to
a public company! Unaided by England, Borneo seems likely to suffer in two ways&#x2014;either
to be annexed by the Government of Manilla, or else to fall into the hands of the
promoters of public companies. The Sulu Archipelago has already thus lost its independence;
and the question which now suggests itself is, What will England do with her foster-colony,
Borneo the Beautiful?
</p>
<p>Borneo offers to the student of nature an ever-interesting field for research and
study. The local government is very peculiar and interesting. Every village of any
pretensions has its &#x201c;Orang Kaya,&#x201d; or head man, and his house is at the service of
the passing stranger. In any <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e187" href="#xd29e187">ix</a>]</span>matter of dispute he may be referred to, and my own experience of these petty rulers
was on the whole very satisfactory. I found them honest and just in their advice,
although at times a little grasping in their bargains.
</p>
<p>The ease with which food is obtained in such a tropical land is of course inimical
to any great exertion or progress on the part of the natives. That most generous of
all food-giving plants, the Banana, is everywhere naturalised in Borneo up to an altitude
of 3000 feet. It fruits all the year, its produce being to that of wheat as 133:1,
and to that of the potato as 44:1. With rice and a few esculent roots, all easily
grown, it gives a profusion of food at a slight expenditure of labour&#x2014;labour for the
most part performed by the women. The Malays of Borneo are morally far inferior to
the inland tribes; and, wherever it is possible to them, live in voluptuous ease.
</p>
<p>Borneo is the home of the &#x201c;Orang-utan,&#x201d; or &#x201c;wild man of the woods,&#x201d; an animal which,
with its African relative, the &#x201c;Gorilla,&#x201d; has occupied the attention of so many of
the first thinkers of our time. Here, in its native forests, this large man-like ape
lives in the great natural orchards, swinging itself from bough to bough with its
peculiarly long arms, building its platform or nest of leafy branches, and eating
its meal of fruit in peace. &#x201c;Let any naturalist,&#x201d; says a modern observer, &#x201c;who is
prejudiced against the Darwinian views go to the forests of Borneo. Let him there
watch from day to day this strangely human form in all its various phases of existence.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e192" href="#xd29e192">x</a>]</span>Let him see it climb, walk, build its nest, eat, and drink, and fight. Let him see
the female suckle her young and carry it astride her hip precisely as do the Coolie
women of Hindostan. Let him witness the human-like emotions of affection, satisfaction,
pain, and childish rage. Let him see all this, and then he may feel how much more
potent has been this lesson than all he has read in pages of abstract ratiocination.&#x201d;
After all, the Orang-utan is a poor creature, with but an outer resemblance to the
human species. In intelligence he is not only far below the lowest savage, but even
inferior to the horse or the dog. No amount of teaching will make the Orang-utan or
any other ape practically useful to man. Do all we can for them in a state of confinement,
they are simply big helpless monkeys to the last!
</p>
<p>The avifauna of the island is very rich. Its pheasants rival those of China in beauty.
The great hornbills abound in the fruit groves, and are giants in comparison with
their representatives the toucans of South America. Here the humming-birds of the
new world are amply <span class="corr" id="xd29e196" title="Source: representated">represented</span> by the sun-birds. Mound-building megapodia are common, their earth-works rivalling
those of the termites; and the edible nest-making swallow works in its dark cave dwellings
to satisfy the epicurean tastes of those Eastern aldermen, the mandarins of the Celestial
Empire. One peculiar species of kingfisher always makes its nest in company with that
of a colony of wild bees. Its young may be fed on the young larvae, or perchance the
company of the bees may be courted for the sake <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e199" href="#xd29e199">xi</a>]</span>of their protection in the event of the nest being attacked.
</p>
<p>Amongst my own introductions to European gardens is a singular species of pitcher
plant or nepenthes, the urns of which are armed with two sharp and strong spines (see
p. 341). Its pitchers always contain insects of various kinds, and I am convinced
that the spines are present to prevent birds and insect-hunting animals such as the
tarsier from removing these insects from the urns. The stalk of this nepenthes is
swollen quite near to the pitcher in a singular manner, and is there punctured by
a peculiar species of ant, but I could never satisfactorily account for their presence,
unless it be in search of water.
</p>
<p>Beccari, during his travels in Borneo, discovered a singular plant&#x2014;Myrmecodia&#x2014;parasitic
on low jungle trees. Its economy is most interesting. The young seedlings, when about
an inch in height, are punctured or bitten by an ant, an operation which causes the
stem to become gouty and eventually hollow; in fact, a natural living hive in which
the ants then shelter themselves. This is their own gain, and they in turn rush out
to resent any attack which may be made on their living nest. A case analogous to this
of mutual protection is recorded of an African species of acacia. The most singular
thing in connection with this co-operative affair is that unless the young seedling
plants are bitten in due course they are said by Beccari to die. I saw this plant
daily for a long period, and often amused myself by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e204" href="#xd29e204">xii</a>]</span>attacking it in order to see how invariably the ants rushed out in force to repel
the intruder. I also noted many young seedlings both living and dead, but of my own
knowledge could scarcely venture so far as to say that the dead ones had succumbed
owing to the ants having neglected to bite them!
</p>
<p>An account of some of the more remarkable of my discoveries and introductions may
be found in the Appendix to this volume, p. 339.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, I may be allowed to say that the far interior of Borneo still remains
to be explored. It is emphatically a wild land without roads or bridges, and a march
right across the island from the north-east to the north-west coast, although a formidable
undertaking, would if accomplished reveal much that is at present unknown.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When our ship had nearly reached the mouth of the Mersey, on her outward voyage, the
boatswain and his men were busily engaged in lashing everything moveable in its place
on deck. &#x201c;We shall get it to-night,&#x201d; said that man of the sea; but on the vessel went
as smoothly as ever, and everybody was merry at dinner-time, hours after the &#x201c;Bosun&#x2019;s&#x201d;
prophecy. We watched the setting sun, and a gorgeous after-glow of purple, grey, and
gold. Then came the twilight, and a sense of chilliness. The land on the port-side
was lost in a soft grey mist; then it became colder and darker, and we went below.
The saloon looked bright and cheerful, with its sparkle of glasses in the swinging
racks, and the mellow light of the lamps.
</p>
<p>I read for an hour or more, and then &#x201c;turned in,&#x201d; heartily glad to think we were having
such a smooth and pleasant time, and that the &#x201c;Bosun&#x2019;s&#x201d; prediction had not been verified.
I was soon asleep. How long I slept I do not quite remember, but I dreamed that I
was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2">2</a>]</span>falling down a well, and the crash made when I reached the bottom awoke me. I forgot
for the moment where I was, but my first impressions were that, Zazel-like, I had
been shot out of a cannon, and that I was whirling round chain-shot fashion. Instinctively
stretching out my hands, I found myself in my berth, but the ship was plunging and
rolling very much, and everything moveable was knocking about in all directions. Another
crash, similar to the one which awoke me, told of loose crockery going to destruction
in the steward&#x2019;s pantry.
</p>
<p>I spent some time in trying to decide whether the ship was playing at leapfrog, or
trying to turn a somersault. A &#x201c;sea change&#x201d; put an end to my deliberations. Sleep
was impossible, and I was glad when morning came, and I held on to the berth with
one hand, and dressed with the other. That man of the sea was right. We had &#x201c;got&#x201d;
it, and no mistake; and we continued to &#x201c;get it&#x201d; until off Cape St. Vincent, when
we regained smooth water.
</p>
<p>Cape St. Vincent is a rocky bluff, crested with a ruined convent and a lighthouse,
the white walls of which gleam out brightly in the sunshine, although we are fully
ten miles away. After we have passed it, and look back, it forms a much more picturesque
object than when seen directly opposite; and in front of the nearly perpendicular
cliffs is a curious cone-shaped rock, and through the narrow passage between this
and the mainland, tradition says an American skipper ran his vessel for a wager, and
got through safely. The whole coast here is bold and rocky, but not dangerous. Large
craft may ride close in under the cliffs.
</p>
<p>A few miles further along is Cape Sartenius, a rocky headland, which rises perpendicularly
from the sea, and is crowned with a fort and lighthouse; and from this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3">3</a>]</span>point the rugged coast-line falls away towards Trafalgar Bay and Gibraltar, a distance
of nearly two hundred miles. We were fortunate in seeing the red honey-combed rock
at Gibraltar in the morning&#x2019;s sunshine, the pretty little town of St. Roque lying
behind across the neutral ground. To the left the cork woods and Algesiraz. Exactly
opposite &#x201c;Gib,&#x201d; on the African side, is Ceuta, with its lighthouse and fort on the
hill, and square flat-topped Moorish houses below; while Apes&#x2019; Hill stands up clear
and dark against the masses of fleecy white clouds. The straits here are about six
miles wide, and it was near this point that the Moors used to cross, Pict and Scot
fashion, into Spain in the olden time. Of course, like Mark Twain, we saw the &#x201c;Queen
of Spain&#x2019;s chair&#x201d; on the hill behind Gibraltar, and a naturalist friend reminds me
that the rock here is the only place in Europe where monkeys and scorpions are naturalised.
The wag meant &#x201c;Rock Scorpions&#x201d; I suppose, but the monkeys are there all right enough.
By the aid of a good glass, we saw patches of cultivated crops on the low coast hills,
and whitewashed farm-houses were freely dotted amongst them. Now we were fairly into
the blue waters of the Mediterranean, and the coast lines began to recede on either
side. Here and there, however, over the coast hills we obtained glimpses of the snow-peaked
Sierra Nevada mountains standing out clear and cool against the blue sky.
</p>
<p>It was about the middle of June, and very hot during the day time, but chilly at night.
The sea is of the most emphatic blue when you look down into it, but has a purplish
glow towards the horizon. The sunsets are occasionally very beautiful, with their
tints of crimson, salmon, grey, vermilion, and gold. It is pleasant at sunrise, after
a bracing salt-water bath under the hose-pipe, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>to watch the silvery dolphin as they follow each other in line and play around the
bows of the ship, at times leaping clear out of the water. The velocity of these creatures
is wonderful; they gambol around a ship, and keep up alongside without any apparent
effort. A few black and white sea-gulls are the only aërial visitors, except that
now and then flying fish are seen skimming the surface of the blue water with their
glistening wings. In some places they may be seen by the hundred, rising in flocks
from the water, to escape their enemies below. They fly for a distance of two or three
hundred yards, rising and falling in a sinuous manner; and occasionally they dip into
the crest of a wave for a moment, to moisten their wings, which enables them to prolong
their flight. Many were washed or flew on board during the night, and were very delicate
in flavour. The sailors say they fly at the lights, and thus fall on deck, which may
be the fact, as it was only after dark that any were caught in this manner. Some specimens
were sixteen inches in length, but about half that size appeared to be the average.
</p>
<p>We caught a passing glimpse of Galita and Malta on our way. Both were once little
more than barren rocks; indeed, Galita is so still; but Malta has been improved by
cultivation, and now yields much of the early vegetable produce brought to the Paris
and London markets. Tradition hath it that formerly vessels trading to Malta were
obliged to bring a certain quantity of earth with them, so anxious were the Maltese
to improve their tiny farms.
</p>
<p>Port Said was our first stopping place; and, after a fortnight afloat, we were glad
to see the lighthouse, like a yellow speck on the horizon. We went ashore, and saw
the town, which stands close to the sea-beach, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5">5</a>]</span>by the entrance to the canal, with which it is contemporaneous. Behind, as far as
one can see, stretches the arid desert itself. The old Arab town of square, flat-topped
houses, is nearly a mile away to the right. The new town consists mainly of shops
and hotels, with the exception of the consular residences, the hospital, and post-office.
</p>
<div class="figure floatRight p005width" id="p005"><img src="images/p005.jpg" alt="EGYPTIAN WATER-COOLER." width="405" height="582"><p class="figureHead">EGYPTIAN WATER-COOLER.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>I visited the hospital, with the young Irish ship&#x2019;s doctor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>as a companion, and among the inmates saw an American suffering from fever and chronic
rheumatism. In one of the cells, guarded by a couple of Arab sentries, we found a
young, fair-haired, blue-eyed Greek sailor, who had murdered an Arab girl through
jealousy the night before. I was struck by the gentle, inoffensive expression on his
face; but I suppose he did not deserve the pity I felt for him. A public square, planted
with trees, shrubs, and flowers, forms an oasis in the midst of the desert of dusty
streets, and white-washed or stucco houses. Most of the houses are two-storied, and
furnished with cool, shady verandahs; and in some cases they are covered with the
green drapery of a large convolvulus, which adds much to the picturesque effect of
walls and fences throughout the place. In the gardens, bananas, date-palms, bamboo,
and other vegetation common to hothouses at home, here grow in the open air, with
no other protection than that afforded by a belt of tall reeds. Nothing is produced
here, even the necessary fruits and culinary vegetables being brought from Malta,
or the Mediterranean ports. Soil and fresh water for the little gardens has to be
procured from Ismalia, fifty miles away.
</p>
<p>In the markets we found plenty of ripe grapes, fine pomegranates, water-melons, and
great pithy-skinned oranges. Vegetables consisted of lettuce, onions, beet, the Egyptian
turnip-rooted kind, peas, okre, and gourds. Most of the stands were attended by lazy
Arab women, of various ages, who sat cross-legged among their goods, and kept off
the flies with switches of horse-hair. A tight-fitting cap, ornamented with little
gold coins, covered their heads, and their figures were enshrouded in great black
cloaks, reaching to their heels.
</p>
<p>We saw some old Arabs watering the hot and dusty streets with sea-water, which they
carried in large skin <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>&#x201c;bottles,&#x201d; slung behind them, so that the march of modern progress has not yet obliterated
all the old customs and utensils of these singularly primitive people. We took about
a hundred tons of coal on board here. This was brought to the side of the vessel in
lighters, and carried up sloping planks by some fifty or sixty swarthy fellows, who
kept up a droning chant the whole time. They each carried up about a hundred weight
at once in a basket; and the whole gang reminded one of a colony of black ants, as
they swarmed up one plank in quick succession, and trotted down another, after disposing
of their dirty load. Perhaps the Pyramids, and other gigantic architectural erections,
were reared by myriads of ant-like workers, similar to these we now saw.
</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft p007width" id="p007"><img src="images/p007.jpg" alt="SHE OF THE MARKET." width="342" height="392"><p class="figureHead">SHE OF THE MARKET.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>Two mail steamers entered the Canal before us, and it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>is a very odd sight to see the masts of the first one gliding away to the left, nothing
else being visible but the flat sea of sand as far as the eye can reach. Pilots are
necessary for the Canal, and notwithstanding their special knowledge and skill, vessels
frequently get aground. Coaling over, we get under way and enter the strip of salt
water which connects the Mediterranean with the Gulf of Suez, passing through the
flat desert, a distance of about eighty-seven miles. The completion of this undertaking,
apart from facilitating European and Eastern commerce, has also, if local report speaks
truly, benefited the climate of the district as well; a current of cool air is now
attracted along its route, and the precious burden of the rain-clouds has also been
brought to this tract of arid sands, which previously were almost entirely destitute
of showers. Another benefit to the dwellers on its shores is the fish which travel
along this strip of water-way and so are caught close to the doors of those who live
or who are employed along its banks. At five mile intervals along the banks are stations
for signalling purposes, and as the strip of seaway is not broad enough for two vessels
to pass each other, the Canal is widened at each &#x201c;gare,&#x201d; so that one vessel can make
fast while the other passes. The whole thing is regulated by a simple telegraphic
and signalling system. Nearly all these stations have little gardens, but the prettiest
of them all in this way is that at the old Arab town and ferry station of Kantara,
through which many caravans pass on their way to and from Cairo. Here is a tiny hotel,
and several little whitewashed houses with shady verandahs laden with climbing plants
of various kinds. One of the houses is sheltered by a row of poplars, and the colour
and fragrance of the oleanders were delightful. The Arabs call this flower the &#x201c;Rose
of the Desert,&#x201d; and certainly at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>this little oasis it might fairly be said that the desert had been made &#x201c;to blossom
as the rose.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>We reached here at sunset, and the air was deliciously cool and fresh, and a sight
of the dark green poplar trees was most cheering and home-like. Crickets chirped in
the sand, and the splashing of the fish in the Canal was heard very frequently after
we had made fast for the night. The tints on the vegetation and sand-hills by the
banks just before sunset are most lovely, and the sunsets themselves very gorgeous
as seen through the clear dry air. Two of the firemen had to be placed in irons soon
after leaving Port Said, to prevent them from leaping overboard or injuring themselves.
They were literally maddened by some villanous spirituous drink which had been smuggled
on board during the hurry and bustle of coaling in the morning. Here and there we
passed the bodies of dead camels, on which wolfish-looking dogs or vultures regale
themselves. Flocks of flamingoes were seen in the distance. As the air becomes clearer
after sunrise the distant sand-hills resemble islands in a broad lake or sea, an effect
due to mirage; indeed, the semblance of a flat expanse of water lying in the full
sunshine near the horizon is so perfect as to deceive all but the experienced. The
hills of loose sand close to the banks of the Canal are swept quite smooth by the
winds in some places, while here and there the surface is rippled like a snow-ruck,
and the foot-prints on these &#x201c;sands of time&#x201d; made by the passing Arab are singularly
like those made in frozen snow.
</p>
<p>At one of the stations an old Arab offered a basket of very fine fish for sale which
he had caught in the Canal the night before. We got a view of the Khedive&#x2019;s Palace
and M.&nbsp;F. de Lessep&#x2019;s residence at Ismalia just before running through the &#x201c;Bitter
Lakes,&#x201d; and reached Suez before <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>sundown. The passage through the Canal takes about two days, as the rate of progress
is necessarily slow to avoid washing down the banks, and there are frequent stoppages.
</p>
<p>Suez is a larger town and much older than Port Said, but its inhabitants depend almost
entirely on the few residents connected with the Canal and Railway to Alexandria,
and the pilgrims who land here on their way to Mecca and Medina, the birthplace and
tomb of their Prophet. After leaving Suez the climate becomes hotter every day. The
coast-line is backed by barren looking copper-coloured mountains, and the air smells
hot and dry, like that of the greenhouse devoted to the cactus family at Kew. Two
or three steamers with pilgrims on board for Suez were seen.
</p>

</div><p>
</p>
<p>Among the visitors from the coast were great brown locusts, a humming-bird hawk moth,
and one or two small birds. A quail flew on board, and flitted about the deck for
two or three days. Another little bird, as elegantly shaped as a lark, stayed on board
for several days; it was brown in colour, with almost black wing-tips; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>it had a band of white just above the tail, and this gave the bird a characteristic
appearance, especially during its jerky red-cap like flight.
</p>
<p>We went into Aden, and I never felt the heat so much anywhere before or since. It
is a huge Dutch oven of sunburnt rocks without a sign of vegetation as seen from the
harbour. It is astonishing how soon one begins to take a personal interest in a ship
on which a long voyage has to be made. The second mate was the skipper of a China
trader, and tells me of the palmy days before the Canal was opened, and when freights
were £12 a ton. One of the quartermasters was an ex-royal yachtsman, a civil and obliging
old fellow, with a sharp eye for grog. One of the stewards has been a photographer,
and another is a hairdresser&#x2014;rather a luxury to have aboard ship. The old Welsh stewardess
was a character, with nightly tendencies towards hot rum and water and old superstitious
stories of the sea. The captain is a fat, red-whiskered old sea-dog, who knows all
about everything, but evidently never enjoyed an introduction to Mr. Lindley Murray
in his youth. His politics are peculiar, and his motto appears to be that of the ultra
radicals, &#x201c;Down with everything what&#x2019;s up.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Penang was our next stopping-place, and we got ashore for two days, and enjoyed a
walk around the town and a ride to the &#x201c;Falls&#x201d; and the &#x201c;Hill.&#x201d; Two days afterwards
we stepped on to the Pile wharf at Tanjong Paggar or the &#x201c;fenced cape&#x201d; at Singapore,
and our experiences of the tropics really began. The voyage for two days down the
Straits of Malacca had been very pleasant, and we thoroughly enjoyed the smooth blue
sea and clear sky, flecked now and then by tiny fleets of junks with their mat sails
of a soft golden <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>hue, reminding one of cornstacks at home. Bukit-Jugra, Cape Rachardo, and Mount Ophir
towering up above the horizon behind the town of Malacca itself, were distinctly seen
ere we reached the numerous islets near the entrance to the harbour and roads at Singapore.
</p>
<p>A long sea voyage has its pleasures as well as its drawbacks; and in travelling eastward,
more especially, it is quite possible, after crossing &#x201c;the Bay,&#x201d; to get a smooth voyage
all the way. There are times when the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, and the China
Sea lie sleeping in the sunshine, and a steamer runs as smoothly as a canal boat.
Of course a yachtsman of the old sea-dog school is disgusted with this sort of fine
weather sailing; but it is most pleasant to passengers on board steamships who can
lie and read under the cool side of the awning, drinking in the fresh ozonised sea
air, untroubled for the nonce by the cares of business or the whirl and bustle of
the town.
</p>
<p>A curious feeling comes over one on viewing the boundless ocean for the first time
on a calm, cloudless day. It makes one feel extremely small to gaze on what appears
to be the eternity of sea around, with not a speck or a sail to break the view on
all sides. Then when a breeze springs up a sense of freedom animates the breast as
the vessel rushes through the water and shakes the milk-white foam from her bows,
as though also glad to be free. The pleasure is akin to that of the saddle. The exhilarating
motion of the ship stirs one&#x2019;s blood and sends it coursing through one&#x2019;s veins, as
she &#x201c;walks the waters like a thing of life,&#x201d; and the strong pure breeze fans our cheeks
and the cool spray comes in our faces like a shower of dew. Well might Ruskin give
our English pastime of yachting the first place amongst recreations. Nothing can be
more refreshing than to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>stand on board a tight little vessel when there is, according to the poetry of youthful
memory,
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&#x201c;A wet sheet and a flowing sea, and a wind that follows fast.&#x201d;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In the joy of the moment you do not wonder at the sea-fights, the brave sailors, and
the corsairs of old; the men who love the sea and can struggle with it through all
its moods and phases, will be brave anywhere. If the sea does not nerve a man to brave
actions, nothing else ever will. Life on the sea is most refreshing to the average
landsman, and on board ship time flies more pleasantly perhaps than anywhere else,
if it be true that &#x201c;sweet do nothing&#x201d; is the acme of enjoyment. What an appetite the
sea-breezes give one for breakfast, which is perhaps of all meals that least enjoyed
by inland residents on shore. Our floating cities are the triumphs of modern civilised
ingenuity; and during propitious weather in a warm climate, life afloat possesses
for the time a freshness and novelty unobtainable elsewhere.

<p class="first">Hotels&#x2014;Singapore&#x2014;An Eastern Port&#x2014;A Tropical Island&#x2014;Chinese Settlers&#x2014;Chinese Play&#x2014;Tropical
Night&#x2014;Climate.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This port, which is also the seat of the government of the Straits Settlements, has
not inaptly been called the &#x201c;Liverpool of the East,&#x201d; and the applicability of that
title soon becomes evident to the stranger from &#x201c;home,&#x201d; who finds himself on the landing-stage
at Tanjong Paggar for the first time. Here is a range of warehouses or &#x201c;godowns&#x201d; for
the storage of goods, and coaling sheds for the supply of the mail and other steamers
moored alongside. One is soon glad to get away from the heat, the noise of the steam
winch, and the coal-dust; and a gharry or cab having been procured, the dusky Jehu
springs to his seat on the shaft, from which &#x201c;coign of vantage&#x201d; he uses both whip
and voice in urging on at a gallop a plucky little pony, scarcely larger than a donkey,
and most probably bred either in Sumatra or Pegu. You meet other little ponies in
other little gharries coming full tilt down the road to the wharf, a string of buffalo-carts,
or occasionally a neat little private carriage, and you soon become aware of the fact
that Singapura, as it is still called, of the Malays is both hot and dusty. On you
go, and the stuffy little gharry, even if it has no windows, soon becomes as hot as
an oven, and the perspiration streams from every pore. By the time you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>reach the hotels the chances are that your shirt and collar are in the state best
described as &#x201c;pulpy;&#x201d; and if you are of a sanguine temperament, your face may be said
to resemble &#x201c;the rising sun.&#x201d; Of course you have kept your eyes open as you came along
past the rough hedges on the right clothed with red lantanas, the neat police-station
on the bank to the left, with those beautiful crimson and buff-flowered hibiscus bushes
before the door. Then the rows of Chinese houses and shops, an elaborate Hindoo temple
or two of white stone, and then street after street of whitewashed red tile roofed
shops, until you reach the square, where you meet your agent, or to the hotels, nearly
all of which are clustered around the tall spire of the cathedral, which you will
have seen as the ship steamed slowly into harbour. The chances are you will have been
recommended to one or other of the hotels by some knowing friend.
</p>
<p>The Hotel de l&#x2019;Europe is the principal one; but at the time I arrived in Singapore
the <i lang="fr">chef-de-cuisine</i> had such a bad name that I was recommended elsewhere. One is sure to be comfortable
at any of the first-class houses at prices varying from two to five dollars daily,
or less by monthly arrangement. For this sum one may secure a more or less comfortable
bedroom or suite simply whitewashed, the floor covered with yellow rattan matting,
which is both cool and clean. The walls, as a rule, do not boast of anything great
in the way of pictorial embellishment; at night, however, lively little insect-eating
lizards disport themselves thereon; and then, too, the hum of the hungry mosquito
is heard. In the morning you rise soon after gun-fire (5 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>). It is daylight about 6 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>; and after partaking of a cup of tea or coffee, and the inevitable two bits of toast,
you have a walk. Everybody nearly seems astir. While dressing, the chances <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>are you will hear a gentle tap at the door, or hearing it opened very cautiously,
you turn suddenly, and are startled by a dusky apparition in an enormous white turban.
It is an itinerant Kling, or Hindoo Figaro, who seeing you are one of the new arrivals
by yesterday&#x2019;s mail, would like to shave you, or cut your hair, at a charge of half
a dollar.
</p>
<p>Strolling outside into the main thoroughfares you see a strange motley crowd. The
markets are full to overflowing with edibles of all kinds; meat, fish, vegetables,
and fruit lie about in glorious profusion. Here a heap of fresh fish of the most vivid
colours, there a pile of yellow pine-apples or bright scarlet chilies, oranges, pomoloes,
mangosteen and rambutan, Chinese long beans, fresh green lettuces and young onions,
tomatoes, and the hundred and one elements of native cookery, which are perfectly
unintelligible to any but native eyes. Chinese coolies coming in from the interior
of the island laden with fruit and vegetables, or other commodities. Sleek fat-faced
celestials in black jackets, loose white trousers, and white European felt hats, taking
their morning&#x2019;s stroll, and in every doorway gaunt-featured Chinese artizans of the
tailor and shoemaker type sit or stand enjoying the cool fresh air and their morning&#x2019;s
whiff of tobacco at the same time. The Chinese predominate, but you will find dusky
spider-limbed Klings and the more compact little brown Malays fairly represented.
You will notice gharries coming into town laden with Chinese traders, and other vehicles
bring in the European storekeepers, agents, clerks, &amp;c. You return about eight o&#x2019;clock,
and have a bath, and then dress for breakfast.
</p>
<p>As you sit in the verandah or open basement awaiting the gong for breakfast being
struck, various itinerant traders, generally Klings or Chinese, try to tempt you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>with their wares, for which they ask about five times as much as they are worth, or
could be bought for in London. Japanese and Chinese fans, slippers, cabinets, lacquer
ware, and carved ivory goods, all of second or third rate value, form their stock
in trade in general, while some offer gold brocade worked for slippers or smoking-caps,
crape handkerchiefs and shawls, or Indian embroidery, and even socks and white handkerchiefs
of cheap European make.
</p>
<p>Of course, to a new arrival, everything is strange, and not the least perplexing is
the Babel of language on all hands. English, Dutch, German, Chinese, Javanese, Hindustani,
Spanish, Portuguese, and Malay, the latter by far the most general&#x2014;the lingua franca
which all use in common. At last, bang! bang!! bang!!! goes the gong, and breakfast
is ready exactly at 9 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> There is no ceremony. A little regiment,&#x2014;an awkward squad rather,&#x2014;of Chinese &#x201c;boys&#x201d;
hand the dishes in turn. As a rule, everything is well cooked, and there is variety
enough for everybody. Beef-steaks and mutton-chops, one or two well-made curries and
rice, eggs and bacon, cold ham, boiled eggs, salads, vegetables, and plenty of fresh
fruit. Coffee or tea is not so much in favour here in the East as at home, bottled
Bass, claret, or Norwegian beer, being preferred instead. After a long morning&#x2019;s walk,
however, scarcely any beverage is so grateful as an accompaniment to the post-prandial
cigar as is a cup of freshly-roasted coffee. Breakfast over, the real business of
the day commences. All the large stores and godowns are opened at 8.30 or 9.0 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>, and from 10 until 12.30 everyone is alert and busy. Gharries are whisking about
in all directions. The fattest and sleekest and richest of Chinese merchants arrive
in their more or less imposing carriages, boats and sampans are going to or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>returning from the shipping in the roads, buffalo carts ply between the godowns in
town and those at the wharf, the sun pours down its heat and light from the zenith,
and everybody seems intent on making their hay while it shines.
</p>
<p>All the principal stores and shops are either in &#x201c;the Square&#x201d; or its vicinity, and
here you can procure home comforts of nearly every description, together with the
latest books and home papers. You will procure the latest news at Little&#x2019;s Store,
and will see many things there to interest you. Sale &amp; Co.&#x2019;s, and Katz&#x2019;s Stores, are
also well worth a visit, and few of the Chinese shops will compare well with that
of the late Hon. C. Whampoa, <abbr title="Companion of St. Michael and St. George">C.M.G.</abbr>, who was a most influential trader in the place. The &#x201c;Square&#x201d; is an oblong plot of
turf planted with various tropical trees, and one of these, although fast going to
decay, is well worthy of notice, being completely enshrouded with rare orchids of
various kinds. This stands immediately opposite the Singapore Dispensary, and owes
its interesting appearance to Mr. Jamie, who first planted it with orchids some years
ago. Amongst other plants <i lang="la">Aerides suavissimum</i> is especially luxuriant, completely wreathing some of the principal branches with
its glossy green leaves, and many seedlings of this species have germinated and are
now promising little plants. <i lang="la">Vandas</i>, <i lang="la">Phalænopsis grandiflora</i>, and <i lang="la">P. amabilis</i> also grow and flower well here in close proximity to the dusty streets. In Singaporean
gardens the rarest of moth orchids are planted in <span class="corr" id="xd29e775" title="Source: cocoanut-shells">cocoa-nut shells</span> and hung from the verandahs, or placed on the mango or orange trees on the lawn,
where they soon establish themselves. How many English orchid amateurs would wish
for such a genial clime.
</p>
<p>A morning in the &#x201c;Square&#x201d; gives one a tolerably clear <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>insight into the enterprise and trade of Singapore. You hear a good deal about the
price of sago or gutta and rice, or about the chartering of steamers or sailing craft,
or the freight on home or export goods. You are sure to meet two or three captains
of trading steamers. Captain Linguard, perhaps, after one of his trips to the Coti
river away on the south-east of Borneo, and then you will hear something of the rubber-market,
or of the pirates, of whom, perhaps, few men know more than this energetic &#x201c;Rajah
Laut,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Sea King,&#x201d; as he is called by the natives.
</p>
<p>Another maritime celebrity is Captain Ross, a genial sailor, who owns the mail steamer
&#x201c;Cleator,&#x201d; which runs between Singapore, Labuan, and Brunei, on the north-west Bornean
coast. Captain Ross is well acquainted with the principal places in the whole Malayan
Archipelago; and few residents have an equal colloquial knowledge of their languages.
He has been attacked by pirates more than once in the old days, and is quite a nautical
authority in every way. That tall, dark young fellow yonder, with the heavy moustache,
is Captain Cowie, who ran the gauntlet of the Spanish gun-boats so successfully during
the Sulu war, carrying rice, powder, and arms for the Sultan&#x2019;s people; and here one
also meets &#x201c;old sea dogs&#x201d; of nearly every nationality, but more especially English
and Dutch.
</p>
<p>One must of course look in at Emmerson&#x2019;s for tiffin, and a glance at the home papers
and telegrams. Tiffin is much like breakfast, only nearly all the dishes are cold.
The curries here are excellent; and a well-made salad of fresh green vegetables is
a treat, when the temperature is 92° in the shade. The Raffles Institution is well
worthy of a visit&#x2014;an interesting museum of native curiosities and natural history
specimens having recently <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>been formed; and there is here an excellent library of books, on nearly all subjects.
A collection of economic products is in course of formation, and if well carried out,
will add much to the interest of the place. The Botanical Gardens are situated at
Tanglin, a distance of about three miles from the town of Singapore; and as the roads
are smooth and level, it is a very pleasant journey, either in the morning or evening.
One night each week the military band performs in the garden; and then a good many
of the residents ride or drive out to &#x201c;eat the air,&#x201d; and hear the music before dinner.
Good collections of orchids, palms, and economic plants, are here kept up, and the
place forms an agreeable promenade morning and evening. In addition to the plants,
a small collection of animals and birds, for the most part natives of the Archipelago,
may be seen here. The island itself is tolerably flat, the elevated portions being
in the form of low hills, or &#x201c;bukits,&#x201d; the highest, Bukit Timah, being about 400 feet
above sea level. Many of the rare plants, formerly found here, have died out since
the destruction of the old forest for cultivation. Wild pigs are plentiful; but the
tigers do not often repeat the predatory visits of twenty or thirty years ago, when
two or three hundred Chinamen were devoured every year. They now very rarely cross
the &#x201c;Old Straits,&#x201d; a channel about half a mile wide, which separates the island from
the mainland of Jahore.
</p>
<p>In the Singapore <i>Times</i>, however, for Feb. 1, 1879, the following paragraph appeared, which shows that the
brutes have not quite lost their old-established man-eating desires:&#x2014;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Tigers, it would appear, are approaching Singapore town unpleasantly close. On the
29th January a Chinaman was taken away by one on a plantation only about <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21">21</a>]</span>four miles from town; and unpleasant rumours are afloat that some have lately been
seen in Sirangoon and Changhie.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Much fruit is grown; and there are cocoa-nut, gambir, pepper, indigo and gamboge plantations
on a small scale. Vegetable crops here, as in San Francisco, are a monopoly of the
thrifty Chinese gardeners. The trade in economic products of the soil of the neighbouring
islands is an important one, and, ere long, when cultivation extends more fully into
Jahore and Perak, this will be much increased. Some of the planters from Ceylon have
already commenced extensive clearing operations in Jahore; and if these succeed, the
rest is but a question of time. A few rare and interesting plants yet linger in the
jungle, notably, the curious pitcher plant (<i lang="la">Nepenthes Rafflesiana</i>), which, singularly enough, is one of the first plants to spring up after a jungle
fire. <i lang="la">Gleichenia dichotoma</i> clothes some of the hill-sides here as freely as the common brake-fern at home.
</p>
<p>One of the most singular of native plants, however, is that known as <i lang="la">Amorphophallus campanulatus</i>, a relative of the &#x201c;Lords and Ladies&#x201d; of our English woods; but this tropical species
is of Titanic dimensions, producing a lurid spathe, nearly two feet in circumference,
and exhaling the most fetid and repulsive of odours.
</p>
<p>In rambling about the island one comes across fertile little gardens and groves of
mangoes, mangosteen, and other fruit trees, the tenants being generally Chinamen.
The bye-streets of the town present some novel sights to a stranger, being tenanted
for the most part by Chinese artizans and shopkeepers, the workshops being generally
quite open to the street. Blacksmiths, tin-workers, tailors and shoemakers, carpenters,
coopers, and basket-makers here ply their callings, and turn out excellent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>work, although some of the tools used are exceedingly clumsy in appearance from our
own point of view.
</p>
<p>Passing down some of the streets beneath the shade of the piazzas, one meets with
general stores of every description, each with its little stall right outside the
door close to the path. Here you can purchase almost everything; tools, nails and
screws, needles, pencils, cotton, cutlery, ammunition, old Tower muskets&#x2014;indeed nearly
everything in the way of hardware goods, whether Chinese or European. The European
goods are such as are especially made for this market, and the prices are surprisingly
low.
</p>
<p>It is curious to observe how some industrial products are universally used here to
the exclusion of others. For example, &#x201c;Bryant &amp; May&#x2019;s&#x201d; matches, so common at home,
are here supplanted by a neatly made &#x201c;Tändstickor,&#x201d; ten little boxes of which are
made up into a packet, which sells for as low as six cents, although ten cents is
always asked of strangers. In many Chinese and Kling shops European tinned provisions
and patent medicines may be obtained at a very slight advance on home prices, as these
petty traders watch the sales of old ships&#x2019; stores very closely, and are thus enabled
to purchase very cheaply.
</p>
<p>The Chinese compete with all comers in cheap labour; and their innate capacity for
imitation enables them to do so very often with advantage in the case of manufactures.
If you can only give a Chinese workman a pattern or sample of the goods you require&#x2014;whether
boots, clothing, cabinet work, or jewellery, he may be trusted to imitate the same
even to a fault. They are most industrious, having apparently no regular hours of
labour, but often toiling from early morning until far into the night for a scanty
pittance; but no matter how <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>small their earnings, they generally contrive to save something. Indeed it is difficult
to say whether &#x2019;tis their industry or their thrift which most deserves commendation.
Of course they have their faults as a people, and most serious some of them are; and
wherever they are admitted as emigrants, a strong hand is needed to keep them in order.
</p>
<p>For opening up new trading enterprises or colonies in the East their aid is invaluable,
as they are most frugal, and possess a peculiar habit of making the best of circumstances.
In Sarawak, and also in the British colony of Labuan, the money derived from the opium
and spirit farms form a main feature in the revenue, so that eastern colonies, in
favouring Chinese emigration, add to their revenue by their expenditure as well as
by their labour. Many, by thrift and frugality, rise to positions of affluence, and
then it is curious to see how thoroughly they fall into the ways of the class to which
they reach. This makes a Chinese colony so prosperous as a rule; for if a man has
money he is sure to spend it either in trade, or in a fine house, garden, servants,
horses and carriages, and other luxuries. As a rule they deal with their own class,
but they take to European luxuries very kindly. I was asked out to dine several times
at the houses of wealthy Chinese whilst in the East, and was at first rather disappointed
at the thorough European character of the repast. Clean cloth, knives and forks of
course; and every course might have been prepared in Pall Mall, if we except the curries;
and it is but natural that the curries of the East are inimitable elsewhere. You get
most delicately prepared pastry, and ten to one, roast beef and plum pudding, which
are all the world over understood to be our national dishes.
</p>
<p>A gentleman told me that once when in Paris, just <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>after the war, he was conversing with a friend near the Tuileries, when a wicked-eyed
young <i>gamin</i> overhearing his bad French with an English accent, observed, &#x201c;Ah, M&#x2019;sieu rost-bif,
God-dam,&#x201d; as he rapidly vanished round the corner. Many of the rich merchants speak
English well; if not, then Malay is the medium of conversation. And the wherewithal
to wash down your food is not forgotten: indeed, many of the rich &#x201c;babas&#x201d; give excellent
champagne breakfasts, and &#x201c;Bass&#x201d; and good Bordeaux are as common as at European meals.
However addicted to &#x201c;samshu&#x201d; and &#x201c;shandu,&#x201d;&#x2014;the baleful narcotic immortalised by De
Quincey,&#x2014;a Chinaman may be privately, you will find him courteous, and eagerly apprehensive
as to the comfort and enjoyment of his guests on all occasions when he entertains
Europeans.
</p>
<p>Sometimes you meet with a surprise at a Chinese dinner&#x2014;a surprise especially prepared
for your benefit. I was present at one where we had small dishes of rice and condiments
set before us, with &#x201c;chop sticks&#x201d; in lieu of knife and fork. Now a native to the manner
born will use his two chop sticks as cleverly as Mr. G.&nbsp;W. Moore handles his bones;
and as he leans over his dish you see a constant stream of food running up to his
mouth, while with your chop sticks awkwardly held you simply demonstrate what &#x201c;eating
porridge with a knitting pin&#x201d; really means. Well, dish followed dish, and we began
to think the whole thing &#x201c;awfully slow,&#x201d; when the host arose and requested us to accompany
him to the &#x201c;dining-room.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Sure enough we found ourselves in a large and well lit interior. There was a dinner-table
laid in European style, the silver and glass irreproachable, and floral decorations
rather tastefully arranged graced the board. Of course there was a good deal of laughter
as the neat <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>Chinese &#x201c;boys&#x201d; handed round the sherry and bitters as we stood in groups; and a few
minutes afterwards the gong was beaten for dinner in quite a homely fashion. A jolly
old Spanish priest was present, and our long-tailed host did not omit to ask him to
say grace, which he solemnly did, first in English, standing the while, and then we
were all surprised as the rubicund-cheeked friar rolled out a Chinese prayer interlarded
with choice maxims from Confucius, and all in the Hokien dialect of Chinese. The whole
thing was much enjoyed. We had soup oxtail and &#x201c;birds&#x2019; nest,&#x201d; the latter extremely
good, but perhaps rather too sweet for European liking; fish of several kinds, beef
and mutton cooked in various ways, also pork cutlets excellently cooked, as indeed
only Chinese cooks can prepare them; pastry, cheese, and such fruits for dessert as
no money could procure from Covent Garden. Fat juicy mangoes, delicate mangosteen,
rambutan, bananas, and other kinds, never eaten in perfection anywhere but in the
tropics&#x2014;the gardens of the sun.
</p>
<p>A &#x201c;wyong&#x201d; or Chinese play had been organised by our host, one portion of his house
being fitted up as a private theatre, and to this we adjourned after dinner. The performers
were a celebrated troupe just arrived from China, and very clever they were, especially
in pantomime. Of course we understood not a word of what was spoken; and yet so expressive
were the actions that the plot and motive of the play was perfectly comprehended even
in detail. The music of shrieking two-stringed violins, and the rattle of gongs and
tom-toms which accompanied them, however, might fairly be added to Mr. Sothern&#x2019;s list
of things which &#x201c;no fellah can understand.&#x201d; The plot was of an undutiful daughter
of poor parents who was beloved of a youth of her own age <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26">26</a>]</span>and station. A rich mandarin, however, loves and marries her. Her young lover is the
most dutiful of sons, and a good spirit helps him on; while at the same time a bad
one causes the mandarin heavy losses by sea and land. The undutiful daughter has her
parents driven from her husband&#x2019;s gates, where they had come to beg, while her former
lover succours them, and they ultimately die, blessing him. Eventually the mandarin
is degraded, and the dutiful youth is elevated to his place for some service he has
rendered to one of the emperor&#x2019;s favourite ministers. He then makes a speech, telling
how good and clever he has been, and ultimately marries the tiny-footed daughter of
the minister who has befriended him. Nor does the play finish until his &#x201c;poor, but
honest parents&#x201d; and the audience are convinced by ocular proof that a son and heir
has been born of the union, a piece of good fortune for which the rich but wicked
mandarin before him had hoped in vain. The character of the youth was excellently
played throughout by a young Chinese lady from Hong Kong, and I do not remember to
have seen a male part acted much better by a female actress anywhere. So that the
Lottie Venns and Kate Vaughans of our own stage must look to their laurels, as ere
long they may possibly have to compete with the &#x201c;cheap Chinese labour&#x201d; of the Eastern
mimes.

</p>
<p>It was late that night as we drove back to our hotel, and such a night as one can
see only in the tropics, where the moonlight is bright enough to read by, and streams
down like a gloriously brilliant bridal veil over sweet-scented blossoms wet with
dew, and the most elegant of palm-trees, over the gorgeous floral treasures of eastern
gardens, and over the homes of thousands of dusky brides. The sounds heard during
the otherwise still hours of evening or night are peculiar, the clucking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>sound of a lizard in the tree overhead is quite bird-like, you hear some frog-like
croaking in the wet ditch beside the road, the subdued humming of distant tomtoms
reaches you from the hut of a Hindoo Syce, and the almost mournful cadences of a Javanese
prayer chanted by a party of labourers in a garden-house or field-hut reach you on
the cool breeze. Then comes the boom of the &#x201c;Kayu Kutoh,&#x201d;<a class="noteref" id="xd29e843src" href="#xd29e843">1</a> or wooden gong on which the Malay &#x201c;mata mata,&#x201d; literally &#x201c;man with eyes,&#x201d; or watchman,
beats the hour at one of the outlying police-stations. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>Fires are not at all uncommon, and then you are roused out of a sound sleep by a couple
of shots from the signal battery, which shake the whole place. As you lean from your
window enjoying just the last sweet whiff ere turning in for the night you may, perchance,
hear the silence broken by snatches of song familiar to your ears&#x2014;the songsters being
a party of rowdy sailors returning to the ship after a &#x201c;wet night&#x201d; on shore. I am
sadly afraid that the low grog-shops monopolise much of &#x201c;Jack&#x2019;s&#x201d; time and money when
ashore, notwithstanding that there is here an excellent &#x201c;Sailor&#x2019;s Home,&#x201d; furnished
with many conveniences, and supplying the comforts of an hotel at a cheap rate. Towards
morning the chattering of sparrows and the shouting of rival roosters are among the
most familiar of sounds which remind one of home.
</p>
<p>The society of Singapore will compare favourably with that of any British Colony,
and for genial hospitality its residents cannot well be surpassed. As in India, new
comers are expected to call upon the residents first. In my own case I brought letters
of introduction to some of the older inhabitants, and I must here acknowledge how
handsomely those cheques were honoured by them. One scarcely knows how valuable genial
hospitality really is at home, but far away it is pleasant to find how thoroughly
English&#x2014;British, one ought to say&#x2014;is the welcome extended to strangers. Government
House is the Court, of course, and it is needless to say, that all courtesies essential
are there extended to both residents and others. Of course, in a community formed
of many nationalities, and of people whose trade and other interests are liable to
clash with those of their neighbours, there are sure to be little murmurings and bickerings,
together with petty jealousies of various kinds. This is so, more or less, everywhere,
but in the Colonies there <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>are few, if any, old titled families to balance the commercial interest. One may see
some bonny English faces in the carriages which are here driven around the Esplanade
just as along the &#x201c;Lady&#x2019;s Mile&#x201d; at home; or one evening a week are gathered around
the band-stand at the gardens. The climate, however, is not well suited to the development
of the rosy cheeks we see at home; the peach-like bloom too soon gives place to the
soft purity of the lily, and it often becomes necessary for the wife and children
to return to a cooler climate, in order to regain somewhat of the health and strength
of which a lovely but debilitating climate has robbed them for a time. Here, as in
India, this is a serious drawback to many residents. Here, too, there are no hill
stations sufficiently near, or, as yet, adapted to serve as Sanatoriums. Now that
Jahore is being opened up, however, it is to be hoped that a few bungalows may be
erected on Gunong Puloi, on the summit of which the air is comparatively cool and
bracing, much more so than on Penang Hill, and it may be readily reached from Singapore
in two days. The cost of living here, even in proportion to the large salaries received,
is far in excess of that at home, and the mode of life itself is different. Here,
one must have a large house, and if there is a family, five or six servants at least
are needed. The wages paid to these appear small when compared with the cost of English
servants, but at least three times as many are required. The master must have his
&#x201c;boy,&#x201d; the mistress her &#x201c;ayah,<span class="corr" id="xd29e852" title="Not in source">&#x201d;</span> then the cook, water-carrier, grooms, gardener, must be provided, to say nothing
of nursery attendance. Native provisions are tolerably cheap, but many things essential
must be imported from home at an advanced rate. Furniture is dear, and pianos, and
many other necessities, to say nothing of luxuries, must also be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>brought from the old country, and freight, if not commission, has to be added to the
cost. The very nature of the currency used adds to other expenses. Many things purchasable
at home for a shilling, here cost a dollar, at the least a rupee or two shillings,
and the result of all this is that with an annual income of five hundred pounds in
England, one must think twice ere a jump is made at what appears a tempting bait,
namely, &#x201c;a thousand a year&#x201d; in the East.
</p>
<p>The progress and importance of Singapore, commercially and politically, have never
ceased to increase since 1819, when the British flag was first raised on the island
by Sir Stamford Baffles.

<h2 class="main">VISIT TO JAHORE&#x2014;GUNONG PULOI.</h2>
<div class="argument">
<p class="first">On the way&#x2014;Gambling&#x2014;River-travel&#x2014;In the Forest&#x2014;Vegetation&#x2014;A Resting-place&#x2014;Tropical
Fruits&#x2014;Breed of Dogs&#x2014;On the summit&#x2014;Wild Animals&#x2014;Wild Men&#x2014;Sale of Women.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This mountain lies about twenty-five miles north-west of the native town of Jahore,
and is a trifle over 2,000 feet in height. To reach it from Singapore, one must take
post-horses or the coach which runs daily to Krangi, a police-station on the margin
of the &#x201c;Old Strait,&#x201d; and thence little steam ferry-boats carry one on to Jahore, from
which place the mountain is reached partly in boats <i>viâ</i> the Scudai river, and partly on foot through the forest.
</p>
<p>I had agreed to visit the Puloi mountain in company with the government botanist,
and leaving Singapore early, we reached Jahore about 3 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, after several little stoppages on the way. The ride from Singapore to Krangi was
a very pleasant one to me, fresh as I was from the &#x201c;old country.&#x201d; The roads are remarkably
smooth, and of a bright red colour, their margins fringed with orchards of tropical
fruits or rows of betel-nut palms. Here and there are patches of sugar-cane, tapioca,
or indigo, little plots of great-leaved bananas, while at intervals one catches passing
glimpses of neat white bungalows nestling amid tall cocoa-nut groves. Arriving at
Krangi, hot and dusty, we rested some time in a clean <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>bungalow or rest-house, built for the convenience of travellers by the Government.
The native police were very attentive, and we took our luncheon here and strolled
around the station, and saw abundant evidence of the wild pigs, which are said to
be very plentiful. While we waited, the Maharajah drove up in a neat little carriage
drawn by a pair of ponies. This was just before his visit to England, and we obtained
a good view of him. He is a fine manly fellow, with a bushy moustache, and was dressed
in white trousers and jacket, with a white sun-hat, and wore a coloured &#x201c;sarong&#x201d; around
his waist. We informed him of our intended visit to the mountain, and he promised
us that Mr. Hole, his secretary, should furnish us with guides and boatmen.
</p>
<p>We had arranged with a Chinese sampan man to ferry ourselves and baggage over, but
just as we were about starting one of the little steam ferry-boats came over, and
leaving &#x201c;Johnnie&#x201d; to bring on our things and a Chinese &#x201c;boy&#x201d; in charge, we crossed
in the steamboat. We took up our quarters with Mr. Boultbee, with whom we were to
stay the night. Jahore itself we found to be a straggling place built along the margin
of the strait, and consisting of the Istana and a mosque, together with a few whitewashed
houses roofed with red tiles, and native palm-thatched cottages. The best of the tiled
houses are occupied by Chinese shopkeepers, the principal wares being rice, fruit,
fish, coopery, boxes, baskets, and miscellaneous stores. The principal industry of
the place is the timber trade. Extensive steam saw-mills, fitted with good machinery,
are here worked by the Maharajah, a good many natives being employed in the trade,
while the timber finds a market in Singapore, where a depôt exists for business purposes.
A railway was projected to the forest near Gunong Puloi some years ago, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>several miles of wooden tramways were actually laid down, but the work is now suspended.
Were such a roadway completed, it would do much to open up a fertile country especially
rich in fine timber, rattans, and other jungle produce. The culture of gambier (<i lang="la">Uncaria Gambir</i>, Roxb.), pepper and other products now cultivated by the Chinese settlers would also
be facilitated. As it is, the timber is cut as near to the streams as is possible,
and is then dragged by buffaloes through the jungle and floated down to the town,
several logs being lashed together so as to form rafts, on which a man stands to steer
it clear of snags and other obstacles.
</p>
<p>Gambling is one of the curses of this place, and is publicly carried on in some large
buildings near the saw-mills. As the Maharajah derives a percentage from the tables,
gambling is not likely to be suppressed here, as it has been at Singapore. Mr. Boultbee&#x2019;s
house, where we stayed, is a large and comfortable one of wood, and it stands on an
eminence at the north-east end of the town. From the verandah a beautiful view of
the old strait is obtained, reminding one of Windermere, only that the vegetation
is more luxuriant, brightened as it is by a tropic sun. We walked in the garden and
forest behind at sunrise, when every flower and leaf was bathed in dew, and were much
pleased with the vegetation. The elk&#x2019;s-horn fern (<i lang="la">Platycerium biforme</i>) grew on the stems of several of the trees, and we saw it high up in the branches
of the forest trees behind the house. <i lang="la">Nepenthes ampullaria</i>, and the noblest of all ferns, <i lang="la">Dipteris Horsfieldii</i>, were also abundant in the jungle quite close to the sea-beach, and tall gleichenias
clambered up the bushes to a height of at least twenty feet.
</p>
<p>Birds and butterflies were alike plentiful in the jungle, and some of the latter were
very gorgeous in colour. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>After our morning walk we looked over the saw-mills, and then returned with the manager
to breakfast. We afterwards visited Mr. Hole at the Istana, and found that he had
already obtained guides and boatmen, so that we at once had our baggage transferred
to the boats, and prepared to start on our journey. Some delay arose, however, owing
to the man having to purchase stores, and so it was after four o&#x2019;clock before we bade
Mr. Hole adieu on the steps of the Istana jetty and got fairly off. All our heavy
baggage was stowed in a native boat, manned by four Malays, while we ourselves and
our stores occupied a Chinese sampan. Our craft was pulled, or rather pushed, by its
owner, a stalwart celestial; and as he had never been up the Scudai river before,
we had an old Malay sitting on the prow to act as pilot, the stream being very narrow
in places, with numerous snags and shoals. Notwithstanding this precaution, however,
we were aground twice, and the boat heeled over in the current rather uncomfortably.
&#x201c;Johnnie&#x201d; had to plunge out into the mud of this alligator&#x2019;s paradise to push our
craft into deep water again. These were trifling discomforts, however, not worth a
thought amid much that was novel and interesting. We ate our dinners in the boat just
at dusk, and enjoyed the cool breeze which swept over the water as we glided up stream.
</p>
<p>The silence of the night was unbroken, save by the regular dip of the oars; and as
darkness increased, the tiny lamps of the fire-flies became visible here and there
among the vegetation on the banks. As we glided onwards their numbers increased, until
we came upon them in thousands, evidently attracted by some particular kind of low
tree, around which they flashed simultaneously, their scintillating brilliancy being
far beyond <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>what I could have imagined to be possible. During my whole sojourn in the East I never
saw them again in anything like such numbers. The moon arose about eight o&#x2019;clock,
revealing more distinctly the gradual narrowing of the river, the vegetation of which
appeared to be very luxuriant, towering far above our heads. We could recognise the
tufted leaves and tall stems of a slender-growing pandan, standing out clear and dark
against the sky, and here and there the tall dead trunk of a giant tree added to the
weird beauty of a scene, in which the lack of accurate knowledge left much to the
imagination.
</p>
<p>Our solitary Chinese boatman dipped his oars with the same easy swing as at starting;
and about nine o&#x2019;clock he finished a stiff pull of nine or ten miles by running our
boat into the little creek at Kanka Kaladi, he having kept ahead of the Malays, who
paddled the other boat, all the way. On our arrival, all the Chinese who live here
were abed; so we hauled our craft up to a boat-house at the head of the creek, and
got all our things into the loft overhead, and having spread our rugs, and lighted
our lamp, we turned in for the night. Before we fell asleep some of the people, who
had been disturbed by our arrival, came to have a look at us, and did their best to
keep us awake by talking most of the night.
</p>
<p>We awoke the next morning just before sunrise, and soon prepared our breakfast of
soup and biscuit. We had a stroll around the village, which was entirely occupied
by Chinese settlers. The houses were of wood, thatched with palm-leaves, and most
of them were surrounded with fruit-trees and cocoa-nut palms. We tried to hire coolies,
to carry some of our luggage on to the next village, Kanka Ah Tong, where we were
to rest for the night, starting for the summit to-morrow. Unfortunately, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>the head man was away at Jahore; and some coolies, who expressed their willingness
to accompany us, demanded a sum equivalent to five shillings per day for their services,
so we decided to do without them; indeed, the Malays we had with us protested against
this extortion on the part of the Chinese settlers, and said they would endeavour
to carry all themselves.
</p>
<p>We pulled out of the creek, and proceeded further up the river, finally landing at
a place where there is an excellent road, leading through the forest to Kanka Ah Tong.
Here we landed all our things; and our men were fortunate to secure a couple of Javanese
woodcutters, who were fishing, and who were willing to carry part of our gear for
a fair payment. We rested a little in a hut beside the road, in which were two men
suffering from fever, and another, who had dysentery. We gave them medicine, and pushed
onwards. Monkeys were very plentiful on the tall trees beside our path; and we saw
several grey squirrels, and a few birds, including a curious shrike, and a barbet,
which I had never seen before. The trees around us were very tall, and in many cases
festooned with rattans, and other climbing-plants. Flowers were not plentiful; and
although we made several <i lang="fr">détours</i> in the forest, nothing of interest was seen.
</p>
<p>It was very hot in the middle of the day. Our thermometer stood at 93° in the shade;
and nearly all the way our path lay in the open, the sun being very hot overhead.
After the first few miles we came to several open plots of land, under cultivation,
gambier and pepper being the principal crops. We stayed at one place, where the raw
gambier, or &#x201c;terre japonica,&#x201d; was being prepared in a low shed. There were several
low brick fire-places, over which shallow iron pans were placed; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>and in these the leaves and young stems are boiled. The product, when finished, looks
like wet red clay, and is packed in coarse bags, and sent to Singapore, where it realises
about five dollars per picul of 133 lbs. Gambier is a very exhausting crop, literally
ruining the land on which it is grown.
</p>
<p>The Chinese whom we found here were very much interested and surprised at our visit,
and gave us a supply of cocoa-nuts, oranges, and papaw fruit from their garden. The
latter fruit are as large as a small Cadiz melon, with delicate red flesh, when perfectly
ripe. They are not much esteemed; but I thought these very nice, having a flavour
resembling that of apricots. The colourless milk of the young cocoa-nuts, fortified
by just a <i>soupçon</i> of brandy, tasted really delicious, after our tramp under a hot sun. These thrifty
Chinese had a fine flourishing plantation of bananas, but no ripe fruit; and clumps
of yellow sugar-cane here and there attracted the attention of our followers, who
helped themselves to the natural &#x201c;sugar-sticks,&#x201d; without any compunction whatever.
</p>
<p>Refreshed by a short rest, and a cooling draught, we pushed onwards, and reached Kanka
Ah Tong about three o&#x2019;clock. We sought out the old Chinese headman, and through him
obtained the loan of a new house, just erected in the centre of the village, so that
we were soon established in quarters, and the &#x201c;boy&#x201d; then began to cook our evening
meal. We were of course soon surrounded by a crowd of villagers; and a paraffin cooking
apparatus, which the &#x201c;boy&#x201d; had in working order before the door, interested them very
much.
</p>
<p>I noticed an excellent breed of black and white dogs at this village, in build not
unlike a fox-terrier, but larger. These people evidently desired to keep the breed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>pure; for I noticed that all the dogs in the place were the same. A clear stream ran
past the front of our house, and we were glad to get a bath before dinner. In this
stream were at least two species of little fish, the largest rarely exceeding three
inches in length, being beautifully spotted with dark brown on their sides. We felt
deliciously cool after bathing, and ate our dinner comfortably, on seats we extemporised
just outside our door.
</p>
<p>After a smoke, in the cool of the evening, we prepared our sleeping gear, and turned
in for the night. We were up at sunrise, and bathed in the little stream, while my
friend&#x2019;s servant and our men prepared breakfast. We left some of our less needful
gear in charge of the headman, and then shouldering our guns, we set out for the mountain,
a good ten mile walk, over bad roads, and the last three or four miles is stiff climbing
most of the way. Altogether it took us about six hours to accomplish, as we started
at about seven o&#x2019;clock in the morning, and reached the hut at the top a little after
one <span class="sc">P.M.</span>
</p>
<p>The first mile or two the path lies through gambier patches; and at one of the clearings
we flushed a couple of fire-back pheasants, but we were too far off to get a shot
at them. Their plumage shone resplendently in the morning sunlight, as they rose with
the &#x201c;whir-r-r,&#x201d; so familiar to sportsmen nearer home. A tolerably level jungle path
succeeds the gambier patches for two or three miles further, and then the path commences,
leading up the mountain-side.
</p>
<p>Our first stopping place was at some distance up the base of the rise, where a bit
of folded paper in a split stick directed us to the &#x201c;Lady Jervoise Falls;&#x201d; and, as
we stood quietly, the sound of the falling water fell on our ears from the left-hand
side of the path. We <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>soon plunged down the slope, and reached them, but were rather disappointed, as all
the water visible was a brook rushing down a rocky gully, and falling a distance of
five or six feet over into a water-worn basin below. The water was clear and cool,
and we took advantage of it to secure a bath in the shade of the tall trees overhead.
The rocks were beautifully draped with ferns and mosses; and a small species of anæctochilus
grew here and there on the mossy rocks. Its leaves were of a rich velvety-green colour,
netted with golden veins.
</p>
<p>We sat here, and rested awhile, the cool splash of the water sounding pleasantly as
it fell into the spreading limpid pool at our feet. Here, for the first time, I made
the acquaintance of the jungle leech, a most energetic thing, which neglects no opportunity
of taking its sanguinary toll from the passing traveller. Several of them fixed themselves
on our legs, the first notice of their unwelcome presence being the oozing of our
blood through our white trowsers. Their first bite is rarely felt; and very often,
as I afterwards found, it is only by their gorged bodies feeling cold to the skin,
that their presence becomes known.
</p>
<p>The road from the falls to the summit is in places very steep, and the muscles of
one&#x2019;s legs feel it ere the end of the journey is reached. Many of those who read of
jungle travel at home will be sure to imagine it very pleasant to explore a tropical
forest, accompanied by a <i>posse</i> of native guides and carriers&#x2014;with gun on shoulder, and luxuriant vegetation on all
sides, and an occasional shot at a big monkey or a beautiful bird overhead. So of
a truth it is, but in common with all other pleasures it has its drawbacks. After
three or four hours hard walking, varied by a rest now and then, and a few stumbles,
we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>reached the summit, and we luckily were rewarded by a most beautiful view. The atmosphere
was clear, and in all directions a vast billowy sea of jungle stretched below us&#x2014;foam-like
flecks of white cloud being visible here and there on the top of the low coast hills.
</p>
<p>We found the little hut on the summit rather out of repair, but a little labour in
strengthening the principal supports of the roof, and the addition of a little palm-leaf
thatch, made it more comfortable. We enjoyed a magnificent sunset, and lit our lamps
just at dusk, nor were we loath to make a hearty meal of warm soup, rice and tea,
which had been prepared while we looked around our camping ground. After a smoke and
a chat we wrapped our rugs around us and were soon asleep on the side benches of sticks
covered with freshly-cut palm-leaves. We were awoke during the night by the rain dripping
through the roof, but managed to keep ourselves dry by suspending our waterproof sheets
overhead. We awoke at daybreak, but could see nothing but a mass of snow-white clouds
below us on all sides. After breakfast we started on a collecting tour down the mountain
side, and soon struck a deep gully, through which a streamlet washed over the water-worn
stones and pebbles.
</p>
<p>Here we found one or two very interesting aroids (<i lang="la">Schismatoglottis</i>), and ferns were abundant, notably two or three species of lindsayas, their bold
fronds being of a rich green colour, shot with steel-blue. <i lang="la">Dipteris Horsfieldii</i> clothed the rocky declivities of the gorge here and there, and a large-urned variety
of <i lang="la">Nepenthes ampullaria</i> was strikingly luxuriant, growing along the edges of wet mossy rocks. Tiny plants
only three or four inches in height and half buried in wet moss, decayed leaves, and
other forest <i>débris</i>, bore eight or ten pitchers four inches in height and three inches in diameter. <i lang="la">N. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>Rafflesiana</i>, an allied species, we saw clambering up the thick undergrowth to a height of twenty
or thirty feet, but the pitchers were not larger than ordinarily are produced by the
plant when grown in our hothouses at home. A large branching species of gleichenia
grows luxuriantly near the top of this mountain, and seems to replace <i lang="la">G. dichotoma</i>, which is so common in Singapore and Pulo Penang. Orchids were sparingly represented
by a c&#x153;logyne, and one or two other genera, but nothing of interest was observable.
A form of our own <i lang="la">Pteris aquilina</i> grew luxuriantly around the hut where the forest had been cleared. A dracæna, with
green undulate foliage, almost grassy in its tenuity, and the variegated <i lang="la">Cissus porphyrophyllus</i> were plentiful, and a red-veined echites covered mossy trunks beside the stream.
</p>
<p>We returned from our collecting about 5 o&#x2019;clock, tired and wet through&#x2014;a very common
thing indeed in a tropical forest, so that we were glad to strip to the skin and have
a bath, followed by a rub dry with coarse towels, and dry clothes. Our dinner of tinned
soup and boiled beef was very acceptable, and our cook made a very appetising curry
of dried fish and a few chilies collected from bushes which grew in the clearing around
our hut, seeds having been sown either designedly or accidentally by former visitors.
A cup of tea and a cigar were deliciously soothing after the rough falls and scrambling
of the day. We were disappointed with the place as a collecting ground, and resolved
to return to the richer forest of the lower slopes near Kanka Ah Tong on the morrow.
Our guides gave us an account of this mountain, and assured us that tigers were not
uncommon, and that the Chinamen were frequently carried off by them when working in
clearings near the forest. Wild pigs, monkeys, and deer, are plentiful. The Argus
and fire-back pheasant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>are found here, and alligators of enormous size are reported as frequenting the rivers
further inland.
</p>
<p>After dinner we made up a large fire outside the hut, dragging all the fallen trunks
in the vicinity to it, for we scarcely relished the idea of a &#x201c;man-eater&#x201d; lurking
in the neighbourhood, who might wish to vary his diet. These burned brightly all through
the night, although at times it rained heavily, and served for cooking purposes in
the morning. We descended about eight o&#x2019;clock, staying here and there to collect plants
and flowers on the way. We reached the &#x201c;Falls&#x201d; about 10 o&#x2019;clock, and I looked around
for plants, while my friend bathed, and the men rested themselves awhile. &#x201c;Shall you
not bathe?&#x201d; he asked me. <a id="xd29e979"></a>I replied, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just wash my face and hands presently, and let that suffice until
we reach Ah Tong.&#x201d; We were just about to return to the path when a pretty fern I had
not before observed attracted my attention, growing on a bit of jutting rock overhanging
the Falls. I borrowed a chopper from one of the men, and clambered up the rocks, but
to reach it I had to stride across the stream just where it falls over the boulders.
I had secured my prize and was turning to leap back when slip! bump! splash! I went,
plants, chopper, and all, into the water-worn basin below. When I regained the surface
I was washed down again like a cork by the weight of water pouring down from above,
but the next time I struck out for the side and crawled out like a half-drowned rat.
My friend and our Malays had a hearty laugh over my misadventure, and I was fortunately
not injured in any way. I took off my clothes and wrung them as near dry as possible
and then put them on again, and it is astonishing what an excellent substitute wet
clothes so treated are when dry ones are not procurable, especially if they can be
dipped in sea <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>water and again wrung dry. We walked on rapidly, staying here and there in open places
where the vegetation was especially luxuriant to collect such plants as interested
us. About 1 o&#x2019;clock we reached Kanka Ah Tong, and I took the opportunity of at once
having another bath&#x2014;not an accidental one this time&#x2014;and of getting into dry clothes.
I also took a dose of quinine in a glass of brandy-and-water, and felt no ill effects
from my accident and long walk in wet clothing.
</p>
<p>We stayed here for the night, and the next day we returned to Jahore, and crossing
the straits reached Singapore about 6 o&#x2019;clock. In returning down the Scudai river
we saw a slender habited pandanus bearing its crimson fruit in clusters among its
long glaucus leaves, and in places on the margins of the stream the beautiful red-sheathed
areca palm was very beautiful. Although this journey was a singularly unproductive
one so far as the discovery of new plants of horticultural or botanical interest were
concerned, yet it had taught me much in other ways, and gave me an insight into the
habits and customs of the Malays, whose language I had commenced to learn as soon
as I landed in Singapore for the first time.
</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that this Puloi mountain is not more readily accessible, seeing
that at its summit the air is deliciously fresh and cool, and beautiful views are
obtainable. A good road thither, and a bungalow or two, are all that are needed in
order to make this a valuable sanatorium for residents in Singapore, who are worse
off in this respect than the Penang people, who have a cool health station, with bungalows,
&amp;c., on the &#x201c;Hill,&#x201d; which is only a pleasant pony-ride from the town.
</p>
<p>Apart from the Malay and Chinese inhabitants of Jahore, there are tribes of wild men
or Jakuns, who are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>believed to be the descendants of the aboriginal population. These reside in the interior
of the country, some of the tribes even construct their rude dwellings in the trees,
and wherever land culture is by them adopted it is of the most rude and primitive
description. As a rule, their life is nomadic. Dr. Maclay visited these people in
1875, and the following are some of his observations respecting them:&#x2014;<a class="noteref" id="xd29e989src" href="#xd29e989">1</a>
</p>
<p>&#x201c;These people are thoroughly disinclined to improvement of any kind in their mode
of life, intellectually or otherwise, although it is not occasioned by want of opportunity
nor from want of brain.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;3. That these tribes are gradually becoming extinct not only the Malays, but also
they themselves are fully aware.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;This process of extinction is due mainly to the following causes:&#x2014;
</p>
<ul>
<li>&#x201c;<i>a.</i> The constant advance into the jungle of the Malay and Chinese population displaces
the original occupiers of the soil, who retire into greater solitude.
</li>
<li>&#x201c;<i>b.</i> Owing to frequent intermarriages between the Malays and the &#x2018;utan&#x2019; women, the latter
race is becoming intermixed into the former, and this mixed race is fast increasing.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>&#x201c;In spite of the almost foregone conclusion with which I set out upon my journey,
and after severely criticising upon my return the observations I made, I cannot doubt
the fact of the <i>existence of an aboriginal non-Malayan population</i>. Furthermore, previous experience and intimate knowledge of the Papuan race lead
me to the conviction that this aboriginal population is not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>only <i>not</i> of Malay origin, but probably related to the Papuans. Here and there I came across
individuals whom I could not consider otherwise than as retrogrades to the main aboriginal
type. In most of these cases the hair, though not absolutely identical with that of
the pure Papuan type, resembled in texture and in growth that of the Papua-Malay (mixed
race) of the west coast of New Guinea, who are by no means inconsiderable in number.
In these individual cases the hair was quite different from the curled hair of the
other orang-utans.
</p>

<p class="first">(Male and Female)
</p>
<p><i>To face page 44.</i></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>&#x201c;My chief reasons for my decision on this point, are deduced from the existence of
these retrograde instances from the present to the aboriginal type: the fact that
the orang-utans are not easily distinguishable from the Malays inhabiting the interior
of Jahore, does not diminish this decision, because these Malays gradually by intermarriages
have partly inherited the orang-utan type. This intermarriage has been in practice
for centuries, and is likely to have been occasioned by the flight into the interior
of those of the Coast-Malays, who preferred retirement in the jungle to embracing
the doctrines of Islam at the time of the Mahomedan conquest in these parts. To such
causes are mainly attributable the variations in the type, and the diversity in the
skull formations which I met with in my journey. In size the &#x201c;orang-utan&#x201d; are strikingly
diminutive. The men rarely exceed four feet eight inches in height, whilst I came
across many instances of women, mothers of several children, whose stature was about
four feet two inches. Some allowance in these cases must be made consequent on the
early marriages, and the defective nourishment at all times.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Some of the &#x2018;orang-utan&#x2019; whilst preserving their traditional habits and mode of existence,
continue to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>dwell in the neighbourhood of the Malay population, selling to them the best-looking
and strongest of their daughters. It is rare for the &#x2018;orang-utan&#x2019; to change to Islamism
or to adopt the Malay habits of life. In these cases their aboriginal language has
yielded to the Malay and become entirely forgotten as if it had never existed. Such
are the conclusions arrived at after wandering in Jahore, which I traversed from the
Straits of Malacca to the China Sea. In the study of these people I felt as if I were
commencing the perusal of an interesting old work, of whose semi-effaced pages some
were missing.&#x201d;<a class="noteref" id="xd29e1026src" href="#xd29e1026">2</a>

</div>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Setting forth for the first time in a new country, of which but little is generally
known, is always exciting work, and as a rule things turn out to be very different
to what one had imagined they would be. I had pictured to myself landing in Borneo
beneath a hot sun, and at one of the trading stations; but, on the contrary, it was
a dark stormy night when I reached its shores amid a perfect deluge of cold rain;
the thunder and lightning was more impressive than I ever saw it before or since,
and the place where I landed was an obscure little village of scarcely a dozen palm-leaf
huts, and up a river nearly twenty miles from the coast. It came about in this way.
The Hon. W.&nbsp;H. Treacher, of Labuan, very kindly undertook to introduce me to the Bornean
Kadyans and Muruts&#x2014;the last a head-hunting tribe&#x2014;who had settlements near the head
of the Lawas and Meropok rivers a little to the northward of the capital. We crossed
in a small open boat pulled by eight Brunei men with paddles, which is here the usual
and best way of making short sea or river journeys. We started from the fishmarket
pier, Labuan, about 9 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> on September 7th, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>and soon after turned into our rugs beneath the awning and slept until morning. We
awoke about daybreak, and found ourselves some miles distant from the mouth of the
river; but the heavy swell we had had all night had now subsided, and the men were
making headway fast. About 7.30 they stopped pulling suddenly, and pointed to a large
sea-snake lying full length on the surface of the water in the sun. It was about eight
feet in length, and of a blue-black colour, barred with rich golden-yellow, the belly
being dull white. Mr. Treacher fired at it with a shot-gun, striking it about the
centre of its body; and we could see quite plainly where the shot had ripped the skin.
As it lay quite motionless after the shot for several seconds, we imagined it to be
dead, but on the men paddling the boat towards it it dived quite suddenly; and as
the water was clear and still, we could distinguish it at a great depth below the
surface. A week or two before, during my voyage from Singapore to Labuan, we had noticed
a good many of these snakes on the surface of the sea, but none so large as the one
seen here. The natives say it is a very dangerous kind, and some strange tales are
told of their hiding themselves in boats and huts near the shore. About ten o&#x2019;clock
we entered the mouth of the Lawas, the well-wooded banks of which formed a beautiful
foreground to the picturesque mountains behind, which rise higher and higher right
away into the interior. We soon reached the first cluster of huts on the right bank,
and it is here that one of the Sultan&#x2019;s relatives, Pangeran Bazar, resides. His house
is built on nebong piles over the water, from which you climb up a rude ladder on
to a spacious platform, on which are half-a-dozen or more brass swivel guns of native
manufacture. This platform is roofed over, and an immense wooden drum hangs over the
entrance. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>This is formed of a hollow tree trunk, over one end of which a deer or goat skin is
stretched lightly by means of a rattan ring and wooden wedges. It is beaten in the
evening after the old Pangeran has read from the Koran, and sometimes on the arrival
of strangers. Beyond the platform is a large public hall, wherein strangers may rest,
and where the natives meet to hear the Koran read, or to talk.
</p>
<p>The Pangeran&#x2019;s private residence is behind, and differs but little from the other
half-dozen palm-leaf houses around it, being merely a superior sort of shed, with
mats in place of doors. Duties to the amount of ten per cent. are collected from the
natives who bring gutta, rice, or other produce down the river; but by many this tax
is evaded, as they drop down the river on a dark night in a prahu, and creep out along
the coast, lying up some creek until a favourable breeze enables them to hoist sail
for Labuan. I have stayed several times at this place, and always found this river
chief obliging and hospitable, but a chronic deafness on his part makes a conversation
with him anything but easy. He read from the Koran most evenings when I was there,
the choruses or responses being chanted&#x2014;I ought to say yelled&#x2014;by five or six wicked
young Malay boys, who amused themselves by laughing and talking, except just when
their vocal powers were needed.
</p>
<p>Two or three hundred yards further up the river is the residence of Pangeran Tanga,
and here we went ashore to eat our breakfast of cold fowl and rice, eggs and fruit,
followed by coffee and a weed. We bought a dozen new-laid eggs here, also some freshly-plucked
bananas, and a splendid durian fruit, nearly as large as a child&#x2019;s head. We noticed
a half-finished prahu, or native boat, under one of the sheds, the timbers of which
were well <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>modelled, being fastened together with stout wooden pegs. After our men had cooked
their rice and fish, we again started up the river for Meringit, a Kadyan settlement
at the head of the Meropok branch; but owing to the strong current coming down, we
did not reach the place until after dark, and, as before remarked, in a drenching
thunder-storm. It was so dark that our men could not find the proper landing-place,
and having ourselves just left a fairly lighted boat, we could not see a yard ahead
in the blinding rain, and so we were soon drenched as we floundered along up to our
knees in the soft mud of the river bank. At last two boys came down from the houses
in answer to the shouts of our boatmen, and under their guidance we reached dry quarters
after a few stumbles over logs and through the long grass. Our first care was to throw
off our wet things and get on dry ones, after a rub with a dry towel, and we then
ate our dinner, surrounded by most of the swarthy-skinned villagers, who flocked in
to look at us. Afterwards it cleared up a bit, and hearing music in a neighbouring
house, we adjourned thereto, and found a few of the young men and women enjoying themselves.
Their instruments consisted of a native-made violin on a European model, a curious
kind of native banjo made of a single joint of a large bamboo, a triangle, or its
music rather, being represented by two or three steel hatchet heads, which were laid
across laths on the floor, and beaten in time with a bit of iron. The music so produced
was of a rather melancholy description, and one or two of the girls and boys danced
a little, a mat being spread for the purpose; but their dancing is merely shuffling
about in a more or less slow and stately manner, a singular effect being produced
by the graceful way in which the arms are waved about in all directions. This <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>was particularly noticeable in the case of one of the performers, who waved a handkerchief
about during the dance, changing it from one hand to the other, until eventually it
vanished from sight altogether; still the arms waved, and the fingers, in their ever
slow changing movement, resembled tentaculæ groping for their prey as they were slowly
waved through the air in every possible direction, presumably in quest of the lost
article, the ultimate recovery of which terminated the dance. The only light in the
apartment was the lurid flickering of a dammar torch, and its reflections on the faces
and slightly-draped forms of the performers and lookers-on produced a weird effect,
which was intensified by the silence of all present.
</p>
<p>The next day &#x201c;Bongsur,&#x201d; a well-known bird-hunter of the district, and a party of natives,
undertook to guide us to the forest we wished to explore, and we set off up one of
the largest creeks in a canoe, followed by two or three others containing our men
and guides. After paddling about a mile we landed, and after walking through several
clearings in the hot sun, the primæval forest was at length reached, where it was
much cooler and more pleasant, the sun&#x2019;s rays being screened from us by the masses
of leaves, epiphytes, and flowers overhead. After mountain climbing, and the wonders
of the sea, perhaps nothing suggests one&#x2019;s own littleness more forcibly than a walk
through the old forests which exist in tropical lowlands. There is a comparative dearth
of undergrowth,&#x2014;but a hundred feet or more overhead the birds, insects, and flowers
enjoy the bright light and warmth denied to all below. The monkeys and birds too find
their favourite fruits aloft, and fling the husks below at your feet.
</p>
<p>Nothing can possibly be of more interest to lovers of exotic plants generally, than
to be able to form some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>idea of their native homes, so far as description can possibly supply the place of
travel. The earth&#x2019;s surface is like the sea, inasmuch as it is pretty nearly the same
all the world over, but in countries where the mean temperature is thirty or forty
degrees higher than in England, the clothing of the earth, so far as represented by
vegetation, is of a luxuriance we can scarcely imagine, and the variety caused by
the addition of such distinct types as tall palms, bananas, grasses, or bamboos and
tree ferns to the more ordinary kinds of tree beauty, and the further clothing of
these with epiphytes and parasites of the most singular or beautiful description,
makes up a scene of immense interest.
</p>
<p>Epiphytal orchids are essentially heat-lovers&#x2014;like palms they are children of the
sun. One may often travel a long way in the islands where these plants are most abundant
without catching a glimpse of them; and this is especially true of <i lang="la">Phalænopsis grandiflora</i>, which is of all orchids perhaps the least obtrusive in its native habitats. This
trait is, however, the unobtrusiveness of high birth, they do not care to touch the
ground, but rather prefer a sphere of their own high up in the trees overhead. The
plants have a charming freedom of aspect, as thus seen naturally high up in mid-air,
screened from the sun by a leafy canopy, deluged with rains for half the year or more
at least, and fanned by the cool sea-breezes or monsoons, which doubtless exercise
some potent influence on their health&#x2014;an influence which we can but rarely apply to
them artificially, and the greatly modified conditions under which we must perforce
cultivate them may not render this one so desirable as it sometimes appears to be
abroad.

<p class="first"><i>To face page 52.</i></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>In the lowland forests near the equator a peculiar phase of vegetation is not unfrequently
seen. Trees one hundred <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>feet to two hundred feet in height tower upwards on all sides; and one walks in the
shade&#x2014;diffused light is perhaps the more correct expression&#x2014;the tree trunks being
the pillars of Nature&#x2019;s cathedral, and the leafy branches high up above represent
the roof. All the vegetation you see around you on earth, rocks or fallen trunks,
is represented by a few ferns, lindsayas, with bright steel-blue fronds a yard high,
broad-leaved aroids, or ginger-worts; but epiphytes of all kinds seem totally absent:
and the truth is, that, like lovable &#x201c;Tom Bowling,&#x201d; of Dibdin&#x2019;s minstrelsy, they,
too, have &#x201c;gone aloft.&#x201d; Above you is a world of light and air and sunshine which birds,
insects, and flowers alike enjoy. You feel very small and helpless as you try to catch
a glimpse of the plants and flowers so high above you, and almost envy the long-armed
red monkeys that swing themselves so easily from bough to bough. The monkey, however,
has a rival in the human natives of these forest wilds, and it would be extremely
puzzling to find a tree so thick, or tall, or otherwise so difficult to climb, that
the lithe and dusky native would fail to reach its summit. The chances are that he
will literally walk up a slender tree in the neighbourhood with the aid of hands and
feet, and then find a route to the one you wish him to explore by way of the interlaced
branches so high above you. If any sufficiently stout lianas are dangling near, he
ascends hand-over-hand in a way that would delight the most accomplished gymnast;
and if the tree so stood that the ascent could only be accomplished by the direct
way of its own gigantic trunk, then the chances are that a stair of bamboo pegs would
enable the ingenious savage to effect his object of scouring the branches, and sending
the epiphytes in showers to your feet. Nor does he neglect to glean such other jungle
produce as comes in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>his way, such as gutta or indiarubber, camphor, dammar, or forest fruits for food
or medicine.
</p>
<p>This is in the forest primæval, but near clearings, or on the skirts of the forest
near rivers, which let in the light and air, the <span class="corr" id="xd29e1075" title="Source: phalænopsids">phalænopsis</span> and other epiphytes are less ambitious, and they may then be found in positions but
little above the more plebeian terrestrial kinds of vegetation. This is also the case
when, as sometimes happens, they are found on the trees which fringe little islands;
and then not only do the plants receive a good deal of sunshine as it streams through
the leafy twigs of the branches to which they cling, but it is also reflected back
again from the glistening sea. The intense light in which they thus exist, added to
the fervent heat and the deluge of rain which falls during six or seven months of
the year, accounts for the enormous leaf and root growth made by these plants in their
native habitats. The flowering of the plants is not so extraordinary, indeed rather
disappointing, after the results which may be seen in English gardens. It is not so
much the paucity of flowers produced, however, as their early destruction caused by
the &#x201c;unbidden guests&#x201d; the orchids are made to entertain.
</p>
<p>High up overhead the most lovely orchids hold their court in the sunshine: here they
are really &#x201c;at home&#x201d; to their winged visitors. Now and then, however, you come across
a newly-fallen tree&#x2014;a very monarch of the woods&#x2014;which has succumbed to old age and
rude weather at last, and has sunk to the earth from which it sprang a seedling generations
ago; its branches laden with everything inanimate, which had made a home in its branches.
Some of these ruined trunks are perfect gardens of beauty, wreathed with graceful
climbing plants, and gay with flowers and foliage. The fall of a large <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>tree, and its smaller dependents, lets in the sun, and so the epiphytes do not suffer
much for a time; and one may thus observe them in all their beauty.
</p>
<p>Here, right in the collar of the tree, is a plant of the grammatophyllum orchid, big
enough to fill a Pickford&#x2019;s van, and just now opening its golden-brown spotted flowers
on stout spikes two yards long. There, on that topmost branch, is a mass of the moth
orchid, or phalænopsis, bearing a hundred snowy flowers at least; and in such healthy
vigour is it, that lovers of orchids at home&#x2014;supposing it could be flashed direct
to &#x201c;Stevens&#x2019;s&#x201d; in its present state&#x2014;would outbid each other for such a glorious prize,
until the hammer would fall at a price near on a hundred guineas, as it has done before
for exceptional specimens of these lovely flowers.
</p>
<p>There, gleaming in the sunlight, like a scarlet jewel, beneath those great leathery
aroid leaves, is a cluster of tubular æschynanthus flowers; and here is another wee
orchid, a tiny pink-blossomed cirrhopetalum, whose flowers and leaves scarcely rise
above the bright carpet of velvety moss among which it grows. But what is that attractive
gleam of gold and green swaying to and fro in the sunshine? Ah! that is a beauty of
another kind! And a native, to whom it is pointed out, ejaculates, &#x201c;Chalaka! ular
Tuan!&#x201d;&#x2014;a wicked snake, sir; and we are content to move on, and leave him alone in
his glory. We tramp on for an hour longer, without even the glimpse of a flower being
visible, except here and there a few fragments on the ground, the remnant <i>spolia</i> of the flower world which exists on the roof of this grand cathedral of trees.
</p>
<p>Half an hour further, and the increasing numbers of ferns and selaginella mosses suggest
the presence of water <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>in the neighbourhood, while the patches of graceful seedling calami or rattan palms
increase at every step, the stones and trunks become moss-covered, and then at last
the &#x201c;sound of many waters&#x201d; breaks on our ears with a cool and welcome noise, and a
few minutes later we have &#x201c;struck&#x201d; the stream, as it rushes and sparkles amongst mossy
and water-worn boulders down an open and sunny ravine. Some of the larger rocks are
covered with a palm-like fern (<i lang="la">Polypodium bifurcatum</i>); and filmy ferns, of the most delicate form and texture, abound on the dripping
stones.
</p>
<p>As we sit down on the rocks, a small flock of gigantic hornbills &#x201c;saw the air&#x201d; with
their great wings far above us, making a noise almost like a locomotive engine in
their flight. Butterflies come with wobbling motion down the sunny clearing, formed
by the shallow stream; and, as we are intent on the cold fowl and coffee, which forms
our breakfast, the sanguinary stains on our white trousers prove that the wily jungle-leech
has not been unmindful of his morning meal. How this little slimy monster loves to
gorge himself with gore! The wonder, however, is how they exist when men are absent
from the jungle they infest, as often happens. I suspect that human blood forms simply
an accidental part of their supply. I know they exact all they can from the water
buffaloes; and perhaps even the astute monkey is made to pay toll by these blood-suckers
as often as may be. I have often watched them, when aroused by footsteps, as attached
to a stick, or stone, or leaf, they wave their bodies about, or walk towards you with
a caterpillar-like motion, in quest of happier hunting-grounds. A squeeze of wet tobacco
juice is the best plan of dislodging them from your skin; for if pulled off, however
deftly it be done, there is a chance of a bit of their sucker apparatus <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>remaining in the wound, which will often cause it to become inflamed, and to fester
in a troublesome manner.
</p>
<p>We suffered a good deal from mosquitoes during the night; indeed sleep was nearly
impossible, and in very shaded parts of the forest to-day the little pests fixed on
our hands and faces with a persistency that was very annoying. We saw very few birds.
A gorgeously attired bee-eater was secured by Mr. Treacher as we paddled up the creek;
and &#x201c;Bongsur,&#x201d; who used an old Tower musket as a fowling-piece, secured a tiny spotted
owl and one or two other small birds common to this district. We distinctly heard
the whoops and yells of the Muruts, who were out pig-hunting, as we came along, but
did not fall in with them. Just as we crossed the stream one of the men picked up
a fruit of one of the several varieties of durian, which are here indigenous. It was
about the size of a cricket-ball, and only contained two of its <span class="corr" id="xd29e1101" title="Source: chesnut-like">chestnut-like</span>, pulp-covered seeds. The seeds were very large in proportion to the quantity of pulp,
but the flavour was very delicious.
</p>
<p>We had a long walk back to the creek where we had left our canoes, and reached the
village about three o&#x2019;clock, just before the commencement of a heavy shower. As it
cleared up a little about five o&#x2019;clock we took our guns and had a stroll across the
padi fields behind the houses, returning to dinner about sunset. I shall not soon
forget that dinner. Mr. Treacher had brought his Chinese &#x201c;boy&#x201d; who had cooked the
previous day. My &#x201c;boy&#x201d; was a Madras Telinga to whom, of course, the lard or pork fat
which the Chinese use in cooking is an abomination, so that my ingenious fellow, as
it was his turn to prepare dinner, made us a fowl curry, using rancid cocoa-nut lamp
oil in which to cook the fowl. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>We were rather hungry, and tried to get the stuff down, but had to give it up as a
bad job. The nasty taste was most persistent, however; and for several days coffee,
biscuit, rice, and even fresh fruit, seemed to have somewhat of the offensive cocoa-nut
oil flavour about it. I remonstrated with my &#x201c;boy&#x201d; about the matter, with the usual
result. &#x201c;Yes, sah, that China boy bad man, sah; he tell me oil very good for curry,
sah!&#x201d; I have no doubt, but that the &#x201c;China boy&#x201d; enjoyed the joke with &#x201c;a smile that
was childlike and bland,&#x201d; and doubtless he related the story to his pretty Malay wife
on his return, with many &#x201c;Ah yahs&#x201d; and inward chuckling. We made shift with biscuit
and coffee, and a smoke destroyed the bad taste for the time being.
</p>
<p>This was the evening preceding the commencement of Ramadan, the &#x201c;fast month&#x201d; observed
by all Mahomedans, and there was a great burning of gunpowder in the village. Muskets
and small cannon were being discharged all over the place in honour of the event.
Salutes of this kind, and the festive firing of shot-guns, however harmless it may
seem in print, is in reality sometimes a little alarming. The powder used in charging
may possibly be bad in quality; but as a great noise is thought to be the thing, any
defect in its quality is pretty well made up for by the quantity used. I am not a
very nervous person, but I once or twice felt just a little anxious as the natives
amused themselves by firing a charge of five or six inches of powder from a seven-and-sixpenny
German gun. I once saw some Sulus firing a salute from some old dismounted brass guns
which were lashed on the floor of the wharf at Sandakan. They coolly sat down beside
the ordnance, waved a bit of rope-yarn until the smouldering fire at one end brightened
up into a glowing spark, and then plunged <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>it into the touch-hole; nor did they seem in the least disconcerted as the guns sprang
a yard into the air dragging up the nebong planks with them, the whole returning with
a crash by reason of their elasticity.
</p>
<p>In the morning, after breakfast, Mr. Treacher returned down the river, but could not
cross to Labuan until next day, as a heavy sea was running with much wind and rain,
so he had to put back to Pulo Sirra until morning. After his departure I had a consultation
with &#x201c;Bongsur&#x201d; about the country, and eventually decided to shift my quarters from
his father&#x2019;s house to that of his brother, from which the forests and hills of the
district could be more readily reached. A party of natives and one or two Muruts who
had come to the Kadyan&#x2019;s village to trade, soon got all my traps stowed into the canoes,
and half an hour&#x2019;s pull brought us to the clearing in which my future head-quarters
were situated. I found here half-a-dozen palm-leaf houses built on piles six feet
high, a notched tree trunk serving as a ladder by which to enter. The largest house
was forty or fifty yards long by eighteen or twenty feet wide, and being nearly new,
it was clean and in good condition. It was occupied by &#x201c;Bongsur&#x2019;s&#x201d; brother, a lithe
and intelligent young fellow named &#x201c;Moumein,&#x201d; and three or four other families.
</p>
<p>Within, it was simply one large room open to the roof, and divided in half by the
central path, communicating with doors at either end. On the right were the hearths
for cooking, water-jars, bamboos, baskets, and other simple tools or utensils, the
left-hand side being covered with the sleeping-mats of the separate families. Two
or three mosquito nets hung over the mats, and at the head of each hung the parong,
spear, musket, or other arms of the men, other spears, shields, blowpipes, &amp;c., being
laid <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>across the timbers overhead. The floor was of open lattice-work, or rather parallel
nebong laths an inch apart, so that perfect ventilation is obtained; and these houses
are always cool. The owner was not at home, but his wife brought a board and desired
&#x201c;Bongsur&#x201d; to partition off one of the corner compartments for me, which was soon done;
and getting up the boxes, hammock-sleeping gear, &amp;c., the place soon assumed a more
comfortable appearance.
</p>
<p>As it was a beautiful clear afternoon I left my &#x201c;boy&#x201d; to prepare dinner, and started
off to the forest with half-a-dozen of the native boys who had followed from the village.
I shot a pretty scarlet-breasted trogan with beautifully pencilled wings, in a large
fig tree near the houses. We had a rather rough walk through long grass, in which
ugly concealed logs were plentiful; and the only bridges across the streams were formed
of a single tree-trunk, often a very slender one not perfectly straight, so that when
a particular part of it was reached in one&#x2019;s journey across, it had a treacherous
knack of turning round and landing one in muddy water up to the neck. The natives
are used to such slender makeshifts for bridges, and, being barefoot, are as sure-footed
as goats.
</p>
<p>We followed one little stream for about two miles, and reached a rocky hill about
five hundred feet high, where rhododendrons (<i lang="la">R. javanicum</i>) were flowering freely. Hoyas and various orchids were in bloom on the lowest trees;
and it was on bare tree-trunks on this hill that I saw the Veitchian pitcher-plant
(<i lang="la">Nepenthes Veitchii</i>) wild for the first time. It has a singular habit of clasping the trunks on which
it is epiphytal with its leaves, and many which bear pitchers have the blade of the
leaf much reduced. Four other pitcher-plants grew on this hill, namely, <i lang="la">N. gracilis</i>, <i lang="la">N. hirsuta</i>, <i lang="la">N. Rafflesiana</i>, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>large-urned variety of the last named, known as &#x201c;glaberrima.&#x201d; A dendrobium bearing
clusters of milk-white flowers was common, as also were bolbophyllums and several
greenish-flowered c&#x153;logynes.
</p>
<p>The ground in some places was matted with a very pretty terrestrial orchid (<i lang="la">Bromheadia Finlaysoniana</i>) which has leafy stems two to three feet in height, terminated by a zig-zag flattened
spike of white-petalled flowers as large as those of the &#x201c;Spotted Indian Crocus&#x201d; (<i lang="la">Pleione maculata</i>), and having a blotch of lemon-yellow on the lip and some bright amethystine veins
or streaks. We loaded the men with roots and specimens, and then returned to the houses
just before nightfall. It was during the wet season, and after dark each evening the
mosquitoes were most ravenous. As a remedy for this annoyance the women lighted fires
beneath the house, on which cocoa-nut husks were placed and made to smoulder gradually.
This certainly kept the little pests at bay, but the smoke brought tears to one&#x2019;s
eyes, and was almost as bad to bear as the mosquito bites.
</p>
<p>The wild forest fruits were now plentiful in this district, and, as a natural consequence,
birds and monkeys were abundant also, for they migrate to different places as the
fruits begin to ripen. The bird-hunters were busy, and rarely a day passed but I was
gladdened with the sight of some bird or other animal that was novel to me. Argus,
Bulwer, and Fireback pheasants and other large ground birds were caught in snares
or springes, while hornbills, owls, eagles, or hawks, and large birds generally were
killed with shot, or very often small gravel discharged from an old Tower musket.
The smallest birds, especially the brilliant little sweets or sunbirds, were killed
with small arrows from the blow-pipe <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>or &#x201c;sumpitan,&#x201d; in the use of which some of the Muruts and Kadyans are especially expert.
Even large game was formerly obtained in this way, poisoned arrows being used, in
which case the harmless-looking blow-pipe becomes one of the most subtle and deadly
of weapons. The slightest puncture with one of these poisoned darts is as certain
to terminate fatally as is the bite of the cobra; and this, added to the possibility
of the arrow being propelled on its journey with lightning-like speed, without the
least sound being heard, will give an idea of its deadly power in the skilful hands
of savages, to whose ambition the death of an enemy and the possession of his bleached
skull for the decoration of their dwellings on feast days, was the all-important feature
of their social existence.
</p>
<p>I have seen a Murut strike fish after fish with unerring certainty with arrows from
a sumpitan, even at more than a foot below the surface of the stream; a much more
difficult thing to do than one might suppose, since allowance has to be made for the
deviation from a right line which the arrow takes on touching the water. The springes
in which pheasants are caught are set in artificial fences half a mile or more in
length, and are simply nooses of rattan, although rarely thin brass wire is used.
A bent sapling is attached to the noose in such a manner that when the bird runs against
a twig in passing through the opening in the fence it becomes disengaged, and flying
upwards, draws the noose tightly around the creature&#x2019;s neck.
</p>
<p>A device similar in principle, but much more dangerous, is used by the Muruts for
capturing the wild pigs. In this case a stout spear of bamboo is made to pass through
guiding loops of rattan attached to trees or stakes, so that by the aid of a stout
sapling drawn back to its fullest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>tension it can be hurled right through the body of any passing animal, which unconsciously
disengages the apparatus by pressing against or treading on a branch across its track.
These pig-sticking contrivances are very dangerous to strangers, and even the Muruts
themselves are sometimes injured by them.
</p>
<p>One of the Lawas Muruts showed me where the bamboo spear belonging to one of these
pig or deer-traps had been driven right through his leg near the knee. His bronzed
features underwent the most extraordinary and suggestive of contortions as he explained
how it had taken the strength of five or six men to hold him against a tree while
others tugged at the bamboo shaft until they succeeded in withdrawing it from the
injured limb. In some districts these pig-traps are very numerous, and one has to
be continually on the look-out for them. I visited the Lawas district several times,
and had good opportunities of seeing the Muruts, and noting many of their peculiarities.
Their houses are similar to those of the Dusun, but instead of living in separate
houses, one enormous house is built sufficiently large to accommodate from twenty
to fifty families. These houses vary from thirty to one hundred yards in length, and,
like those of the Kadyans, are built on piles. As the different tribes are continually
at variance with each other, and knowing each other&#x2019;s affection for crania, they congregate
in one large dwelling so as to be better prepared for resistance in case of a sudden
attack. These people, and the Kayans who live in the vicinity of the Baram river,
and one or two other tribes of the aboriginal Borneans, still continue the practice
of head-hunting, although the custom is now fast dying out here, as it has in the
case of the Dyaks of Sarawak, and other places further south. Only a few years back
a youth was not allowed to marry <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>until he had taken the head of an enemy, and if any ill-luck or death occurred in
the tribe these head-hunting raids were indulged in at once to appease the malignant
spirits which were believed to have been the cause; or if a chief&#x2019;s favourite wife
or child died, he at once took to head-hunting in a bloodthirsty spirit of revenge.
</p>
<p>The desire to shed blood seems inherent in all savage natures, and is adhered to tenaciously
even after civilisation has reached them, and so it happens that human heads or skulls
are considered the most valuable property of these wild Borneans, just as the Sioux
and other Indians of North America still attach a peculiar value to the scalp locks
of their foes. Even although head-hunting is gradually becoming a thing of the past
in Borneo, still so highly are the old skulls valued even by the now peaceable tribes
who have not taken a head for years, that they can rarely be induced to part with
them, no matter how much may be offered in exchange. In several Murut houses I visited
near the Lawas large baskets full of human crania were preserved as trophies of the
prowess of the tribe.
</p>
<p>It is very rare that anything like general open fighting now takes place between the
native tribes, as was formerly the case, when a party of fighting men would, after
marching at night only through the forests for days together, steal up to the house
of their foes just before daylight and endeavour to set fire to it, after which the
place was surrounded and the men killed as they attempted to escape, the women and
children being made prisoners and carried off as additions to the wealth of the victors.
Sometimes, however, the besieged were too wary for their foes, and either boldly rushed
out and drove them off with loss, or formed ambuscades, into which they unwittingly
fell and were annihilated, or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>perhaps a few would break through and escape to tell the tale. In this way a good
many heads and slaves were obtained, but at present the additions to the baskets are
more rare, and principally obtained by stealthy murders rather than in warfare. The
Muruts and other aboriginals are great believers in omens, and whether on head-hunting
or pig-killing expeditions they pay great regard to the cries of birds and animals;
and if they meet an alligator or a snake, they at once return and wait for a more
propitious season.
</p>
<p>In travelling with these natives as guides, their careful attention to omens becomes
exceedingly trying to one&#x2019;s temper, as they will stop immediately if the omens seen
or heard be not good ones, and if anything more than ordinary duties are required
of them it is astonishing how soon a bad omen will put an end to all further progress
for the day. One place where I stayed for several weeks was within half a mile of
a large Murut house, and their gongs could be heard very plainly sometimes all night
when they were feasting and drinking a peculiar spirit, which is made of rice and
tampoe fruit mixed with water and strained off for use after fermentation. These feasts
seemed to be held on the occasion of any good fortune befalling the tribe, such as
success in hunting pigs or deer. One night they were gong-beating and shouting louder
than usual. I asked the native in whose house I slept the reason of this, and he told
me that they had been out head-hunting for a fortnight, but had failed to pounce upon
any Murut of another tribe; so to end the suspense they had seized one of their own
slaves, who had in some way offended them, and had made a scapegoat of him. I visited
this house some days afterwards, and smoked a &#x201c;roko&#x201d; with the &#x201c;Orang Capella,&#x201d; or
chief, while three of his lusty followers kept <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>up an incessant din on five gongs which were suspended in the centre of the public
apartment. I asked to see his collection of heads, and after a good deal of talking,
a few dry old examples were brought; but after we left I was told that they had many
more, including the one so recently taken, but that they were afraid to let the fact
be known. This tribe had good reasons for secrecy in the matter, since one man had
been hung at Labuan for a head-hunting murder a year or two previous to my visit,
and another would have suffered the same fate had he not died in jail. They had actually
crossed over to the English colony to look out for heads, and ascending a little river
on the western side, had shot a man who was coming down in a canoe. The shot, an old
nail, struck the shaft of the paddle, and passing through, entered the man&#x2019;s body,
after which they made off, but were captured by the Government and tried for the murder.
This identical paddle was one of the first things I saw when I paid my respects to
His Excellency the Governor of Labuan, and when the story was narrated to me it did
not sound very cheering, seeing that I expected to live among these tribes for some
months at least. However, I could never hear of a white man being killed, except by
the pirates from Tawi Tawi and Sulu, with one exception, which was of a man who is
supposed to have been poisoned by his native mistress. St. John mentions one tribe,
however, who are peculiarly addicted to poisoning anyone who may be disliked by them.
The nature of the poison used is not exactly known, but it is very generally supposed
to be a peculiarly irritating fibre or spiculæ derived from some species of bamboo,
the effect of which is to cause a chronic state of sickness and depression, followed
by death. Whatever it may be, it is a mechanical rather than a chemical irritant.
When <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>one travels in such a lovely island, however, as Borneo undoubtedly is, it is extremely
difficult to believe half the tales told of the native tribes, and altogether the
proportionate number of robberies and murders is not more than takes place in the
most enlightened centre of civilisation in the world. The total population of the
island is supposed to be from 3,000,000 to 4,000,000, and when we consider that all
these unchristianised natives (excepting those in Sarawak and the Dutch territory)
live together with no law&#x2014;nothing in fact but their own sense of right and wrong,
and public opinion to keep them in order&#x2014;the wonder is that, even according to our
own standard, crime is so seldom heard of.
</p>
<p>The Kadyans are a tribe of peaceable and well-disposed aboriginals, who, living along
the coast near to the capital, have mixed a good deal with the Malays and speak their
language. It is not uncommon, however, to find the older and more intelligent men
of this tribe well acquainted with several dialects of the interior, such as Murut,
Dusun, and the Brunei dialect, used by the common natives of the capital. They are
mostly Mahomedans, and so are more respected by their Malay rulers than are other
of the aboriginals. They form thrifty little colonies on most of the rivers near Brunei,
and many have settled in Labuan, where they cultivate their rice fields, and occasionally
bring fruit or fish to the markets. They are for the most part a clean and healthy
race, and form a great contrast with their neighbours who live in a more irregular
manner, and are often troubled with skin diseases, this being in a measure owing to
the want of cleanliness and of a regular diet. There cannot be any doubt but that
Islam is a great blessing to many Eastern races, especially so far as cleanliness
and temperance are concerned.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68">68</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Kadyans are very quick in selecting rich bits of forest and in raising fine crops
of rice, which forms the main portion of their food. Rice and fish from the river
or sea, fruits from their gardens or the forest, and a few simple vegetables are all
the food they require. They also collect gutta and caoutchouc, camphor and rattans,
from the forest, and the sale of these in Labuan, or to the Chinese traders who visit
the coast, enables them to obtain cloth, muskets and ammunition, tobacco, and any
other little necessaries or luxuries of Chinese or European manufacture which they
may require. Although less active than the Muruts, yet there are some fine men among
them, and their women, as a class, are perhaps the most refined and intelligent of
all the aboriginals, some, when young, being singularly attractive. The boys are also
bright fellows, with a keener sense of humour than is common in other tribes. They
live a free and easy life, contented and happy, and I could not help contrasting the
peace and plenty enjoyed by these people with the squalor and misery in which the
poor of civilised lands are often plunged. Here, in these sunny wilds, an all-bounteous
Nature, with a minimum of labour, supplies their every want, and it would be difficult
to find another country where man is more truly the &#x201c;monarch of all he surveys&#x201d;&#x2014;more
truly independent on his fellow-man than here in Borneo. Although these people are
nominally Mahomedans, still their women enjoy the greatest freedom and are never secluded,
as is the custom of the Malays of the coast, indeed, many Kadyan houses consist of
one very large room only, there being no private apartment of any kind. This is a
rather singular trait of these people, since even the Muruts and the Dusan have one
side of their houses partitioned off so as to allow of a separate private room for
each family, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>other half being open from end to end and free to guests or strangers. The Kadyans
take but one wife, and are apparently good husbands and affectionate parents; large
families, however, are exceptional. This question of increase of population in the
island is one I could not profess to explain. Here is a rich and fertile island larger
than Great Britain and Ireland, with an entire population scarcely exceeding that
of London. In the old times inter-tribal warfare may have operated as a check, and
even now whole villages are sometimes carried off by epidemics, such as cholera or
small-pox, yet when we consider that there are practically none of the checks on marriage
itself as with us, and the readiness with which food is obtainable in plenty, the
easy and natural way, indeed, in which these people live, it is a puzzle that they
seem scarcely able to hold their own.
</p>
<p>In the case of the North American Indians or the Maories of New Zealand, there is
the competition of the white races, but here they are not crowded out by a stronger
type, nevertheless, the population is supposed to be less than was formerly the case.
If a Kadyan youth wishes to marry, he has only to select a site for his house, and
clear the ground around it for a garden. He may take an unoccupied plot anywhere,
and there is no ground-rent to pay, it is freehold so soon as he has in a manner &#x201c;staked
his claim,&#x201d; by cutting down the brush and burning the trees, in which the other &#x201c;lads
of the village&#x201d; will assist him. The ground is cleared towards the end of the dry
season, and with the commencement of the first rains a few seeds of Indian corn, cucumbers,
betel pepper, &amp;c., are sown, and yams, kaladi, sweet potatoes, together with cocoa-nuts,
and banana suckers from his father&#x2019;s or a friend&#x2019;s garden, are planted. Then timbers,
rattans, and nipa leaves for thatch are obtained, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>and, with the assistance of his friends, a good roomy house will spring up, if not
quite mushroom-like in a night, at the least in a week or ten days. A dollar or two,
or the jungle produce he could collect in less than a month, will enable him to obtain
the few articles of furniture, cooking utensils, &amp;c., which he requires, together
with a new &#x201c;sarong&#x201d; or two for himself and his bride. And she, the dusky beauty, will
have made a few neatly worked palm-leaf sleeping mats and other needful trifles, and
doubtless looks forward to her wedding with as much pleasure as her fairer sister
of the West. The actual ceremony of marriage is here very simple. A payment has to
be made by the bridegroom to his father-in-law, and this varies in proportion to the
charms or other good marketable qualities of the girl&#x2014;an ordinary girl being worth
as much as a good buffalo, or say, £4; as much as £20, however, is sometimes demanded
for the &#x201c;belle of the village,&#x201d; but in addition to the first cost such beauties are
apt to give their husbands a good deal of trouble afterwards, unless, indeed, they
be of Cato-like temperament. Marriages may be dissolved for the merest trifles by
either party, but if by the woman herself, part of the money or goods paid to her
parents is refunded. In the case of the Mahomedans, a woman retains all her real and
personal property after divorcement. A native, in whose house I stayed several weeks,
told me that his wife had been married to another Kadyan before he married her. &#x201c;And
did her husband die?&#x201d; I enquired. &#x201c;Oh, no,&#x201d; he answered. &#x201c;Then why did she leave him?&#x201d;
&#x201c;She did not like him,&#x201d; was the rejoinder. And such cases of mutual separation are
far from uncommon.
</p>
<p>These people, unlike the Muruts of the Limbang, had plenty of rice and other food,
the produce of their padi <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71">71</a>]</span>fields and gardens. In some parts of the island it is extremely difficult to purchase
food of any kind, the natives possessing only barely enough for their own wants. Here,
however, one could obtain fowls, eggs, rice, and vegetables in abundance. The prices
may be interesting. For excellent fowls, from fivepence to eightpence was charged;
eggs fivepence per dozen; vegetables enough for two or three days&#x2019; supply for twopence;
while lodging, fire-wood, and plenty of jungle fruit in season, may be had for nothing.
Dollars and cents were current here, but cloth, especially grey shirting and a stout
black fabric, were also readily received in exchange at a slight advance on Labuan
prices. The men here were willing to act either as guides or carriers for tenpence
to a shilling per diem.
</p>
<p>When I returned to the house at night from the forest, I generally found a liberal
share of the jungle fruit which had been brought home by the men laid on my mats;
and after dinner my own men and the villagers would drop in for a chat by the light
of a flickering dammar torch. Twenty or thirty dusky figures smoking or eating betel-nut
had a curious effect in the badly lighted hut.
</p>
<p>All through the fast month these people never eat or drink anything between sunrise
and sunset, but they make up for this between sunset and sunrise, the women being
busy cooking rice and fish nearly all night. At the end of the month, too, a great
feast was held, at which all in the village and neighbourhood met and smoked the &#x201c;roko&#x201d;
of peace, all old feuds and wrongs being for the nonce forgiven or forgotten. Everyone
came dressed in their best head-cloths and sarongs, being armed with their war parangs,
and altogether forming an animated and brightly coloured assemblage. This feast was
held <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>at night, and for several days previous the women had been busy bringing in fire-wood
and cleaning rice. On the day on which this gathering was held the culinary operations
were on an extended scale, and, at the appointed meal time, great heaps of rice, vegetables,
fish, and fruit, were piled on fresh banana leaves right down the centre of the house.
A dignified green-coated old hadji graced the repast with his presence, and he was
pleased to kill the fowl for my own dinner, according to native rite, and evidently
liked being noticed as a traveller, for his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure when
I asked him of his voyage to Mecca. He complained very much of the insults, losses,
and hardships, to which pilgrims were exposed, but his appetite was evidently as good
as ever, since the clearance of rice and fish he made around him at dinner was something
startling to see.
</p>
<p>These people had but few domesticated animals. The Muruts had plenty of dirty, half-starved
black pigs running about the jungle near their house, and a few goats. They had also
a peculiar race of small, brown dogs, resembling terriers, which are very useful in
pig hunting. The Kadyans had cats wonderfully like our own, but with abnormal tails.
Poultry are represented only by cocks and hens. Some of the wild birds of the forests
are domesticated as pets, the most common being Java and little red sparrows; a beautiful
little green ground pigeon; paroquets of two kinds, one very small like a love-bird,
the other having two long blue attenuated feathers in its tail. Mino birds are not
unfrequently tamed, and they may be taught to speak words or phrases quite readily.
Some of the larger hornbills, the &#x201c;rhinoceros&#x201d; variety especially, are also tamed,
and are most amusing creatures. There was one in a house <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>where I stayed a week or two, and a more voracious bird I never saw. At night it would
perch itself on a stick below the house and croak for hours together, but with daylight
in the morning it would enter the house to beg for food, and the quantities it could
consume during the day were surprisingly large. Everything edible seemed equally welcome&#x2014;rice,
fruit, vegetables, and even the entire bodies of small birds which my boy had been
skinning as specimens were gulped down with apparent relish. Any trifles thrown towards
it were sure of being caught in its great bill, and then thrown again in the air and
caught previous to their being swallowed.
</p>
<p>The Kadyans have an ingenious way of capturing the little green or puni pigeons (<i lang="la">Chalcophaps indica</i>) with a bamboo call, by which their soft cooing notes are exactly imitated. These
birds are gregarious, and just before breeding-time they arrive in large quantities.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;The call is formed of two pieces of bamboo, a slender tube, a short piece 3&#x2033;&#x2014;4&#x2033; in
diameter, and a connecting piece of wood. In the short piece is a hole similar to
the embouchure of a flute; and the lower end of the blow-tube is fitted to this in
such a manner that, on blowing, a soft, low, flute-like &#x2018;cooing&#x2019; is easily producible;
and this can be readily modulated so as to be heard either at a long distance or near
at hand. This instrument is figured in Proc. Zool. Soc. 1879, Part II., p. 346. The
native, who has taken up his position in the forest or jungle where these little birds
are found, blows very softly at first; but if there be no answering call from the
birds he blows louder and louder, thus increasing the radius of sound. If there really
be any pigeons of this kind within hearing, they are sure to answer; and then the
hunter blows softer and softer until they are enticed into <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>the &#x2018;wigwam&#x2019; of leafy branches which he has erected in order to conceal himself from
sight. The door or entrance to these &#x2018;wigwams&#x2019; is partially closed by a screen of
palm (<i lang="la">Nipa fruticans</i>) leaves. This is elevated a little to allow the pigeons to enter, after which it
is allowed to fall, portcullis-like, entirely, so as to close the entrance; and the
bird is then easily secured. Above the entrance two holes are made, so that the hunter
can look out without being seen. These huts are formed of a few poles or sticks, rudely
thatched with twigs and palm-leaves, and vary from four to six feet in height.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;This pigeon is migratory, and arrives in Labuan and on the opposite Bornean coast
with the change of the monsoon, about April. Many hundreds are then caught by means
of this &#x2018;dakut,&#x2019; or &#x2018;bamboo call,&#x2019; and are offered for sale by their captors for a
cent or two each. They are also kept by the natives as domestic pets, along with young
hornbills, the &#x2018;Mino&#x2019; bird or &#x2018;Grackle,&#x2019; a small species of paroquet, and Java sparrows.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>At this season little huts are built in the forest, and the hunter, ensconced within,
blows his call, and they will actually run inside the hut, where they are caught.
The Kadyans and their Murut neighbours collect a good deal of gutta and caoutchouc
in the surrounding forests, which is afterwards manufactured into lumps or balls,
and taken over to Labuan for sale. The gutta is obtained from four or five kinds of
large forest trees, belonging to the genus isonandra, by felling the trees and girdling
or ringing their bark at intervals of every two feet, the milky juice or sap being
caught in vessels fashioned of leaves or cocoa-nut shells. The crude sap is hardened
into slabs or bricks by boiling, and is generally adulterated with twenty per cent.
of scraped bark&#x2014;indeed, the Chinese traders who purchase the gutta from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>the collectors, would refuse the pure article in favour of that adulterated with bark,
and to which its red colour is mainly due.
</p>
<p>Caoutchouc or rubber is in the N.W. districts of Borneo the produce of three species
of climbing plants, known to the natives as &#x201c;Manoongan,&#x201d; &#x201c;Manoongan putih,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Manoongan
manga.&#x201d; Their stems are fifty to one hundred feet in length, and rarely more than
six inches in diameter, the bark corrugated, and of a grey or reddish-brown colour;
leaves oblong, and of a glossy green colour; the flowers are borne in axillary clusters,
and are succeeded by yellow fruits, the size of an orange, and containing seeds as
large as beans, each enclosed in a section of apricot-coloured fruit. These fruits
are of a delicious flavour, and are highly valued by the natives. Here, again, the
stems are cut down to facilitate the collection of the creamy sap, which is afterwards
coagulated into rough balls by the addition of nipa salt.
</p>
<p>It is most deplorable to see the fallen gutta trees lying about in all directions
in the forest, and the rubber-yielding willughbeias are also gradually, but none the
less surely, being exterminated by the collectors here in Borneo, as, indeed, throughout
the other islands and on the Peninsula, where they also abound.
</p>
<p>It was formerly thought that gutta was the produce of one particular species of tree&#x2014;<i lang="la">Isonandra gutta</i>&#x2014;but that from the Lawas district is formed of the mixed sap of at least five species,
the juice of ficus and one or two species of artocarpeæ being not unfrequently used
in addition as adulterants. The Bornean &#x201c;gutta soosoo,&#x201d; or rubber, again, is the mixed
sap of three species of willughbeias, and here, again, the milk of two or three other
plants is added surreptitiously to augment the quantity collected. The gutta trees
are a long time in attaining to maturity, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>and are not easy to propagate, except by seeds. The willughbeias, on the other hand,
grow quickly, and may be easily and rapidly increased by vegetative as well as by
seminal modes of propagation, hence the latter are more especially deserving of the
attention of our Government in India, where they might reasonably be expected to thrive.
</p>
<p>No doubt there are yet many thousands of tons of these products existing in Bornean
woods, but as the trees are killed by the collectors without a thought of replacement,
the supply will recede further and further from the markets, and so prices must of
necessity rise as the supply fails, or as the collection of it becomes more laborious.
</p>
<p>The demand for caoutchouc from Borneo is a very recent one, yet in many districts
the supply is practically exhausted. In Assam, Java, and also in Australia, rubber
is supplied by <i lang="la">Ficus elastica</i>, which is cultivated for the purpose. There are many milk-yielding species of ficus
in the Bornean forests which might possibly afford a supply in remunerative quantities
as the result of careful experiments. The Malayan representatives of the bread-fruit
family also deserve examination, as excellent rubber is yielded by <i lang="la">Castilloa elastica</i>, a South-American plant of this order.

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the 29th of November, just as the dry season was commencing in Labuan, Mr. Peter
Veitch (who had a few days before joined me after his travels in Australia and the
Fiji Islands) and myself started off on a journey to Kina Balu, which we intended
to reach by way of the Tawaran river. We had with us twenty-six men and two bird-hunters,
so that we formed a rather imposing party of thirty, all told. The men were armed
with native parangs or swords; some had krisses, and eight or ten carried muskets
with which we had provided them. We embarked our men, stores, and travelling gear
on board a little coast-steamer bound for Sulu, and the following morning we arrived
at Pulo Gaya, and the captain lowered another boat in addition to the one we had brought
with us, and put us all safely ashore near <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>Gantisan in Gaya Bay. We waited here at a Roman Catholic Catechist&#x2019;s Station for some
time, and I ascended to the summit of the grass-covered hills northwards. These are
forest-covered below, the nebong palm being very abundant, and attaining large dimensions.
</p>
<p>The hill-tops above, which look so smooth and green when seen from the sea, are found
to be clad with coarse &#x201c;lallang&#x201d; grass a yard high, among which the men who accompanied
me pointed out several deer lairs. Fresh green tufts of <i lang="la">Cheilanthes tenuifolia</i> grew in the crevices of the decomposed sandstone, and among the clumps of nebong
palm; a singular fern, <i lang="la">Schizæa digitata</i>, was very plentiful.
</p>
<p>Returning, we re-arranged our baggage, and sending our boat round to Pangeran Rau&#x2019;s
place at Kalombini, by sea, we and the majority of the men started over the ridge
of the wooded hill on foot. It was a stiff climb in the hot sun, the path being both
steep and rough. In descending to the plain on the other side we shot three large
swallows and a crimson and blue-painted barbet; we were also fortunate in finding
a pretty pink-flowered zingiberad in bloom. The flat plain into which we descended
was partly cultivated, and the rice especially looked strong and healthy. Fine buffaloes
were also grazing here.
</p>
<p>We reached Pangeran Rau&#x2019;s house at three o&#x2019;clock, and had the usual <i>bichari</i> or talk, arm-chairs and mats being at once brought into the head-house on our arrival.
Some of the women were busy pounding the rice to separate it from the husk; and one
or two ran away shrieking at our approach&#x2014;it was simply affectation, and not fright.
We found the Pangeran rather reserved, but hospitably inclined. He was a gray-haired
old <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79">79</a>]</span>fellow of over sixty, and spoke but little, asked no questions, and spent most of
his time sitting cross-legged on a mat drinking tea, chewing limed &#x201c;sirra&#x201d; leaf and
betel, or smoking long cigarettes of tobacco rolled in nipa leaf, all being brought
to him from time to time by little Malay boys. The head-house was soon filled with
men from the other houses, who flocked in to see us and to hear the news from Labuan
of our followers. We rested a little, and then walked out to obtain a bath before
dinner. Some natives directed us to a spring about half a mile off across the plain,
which here, near the houses, is of sand covered with coarse sedges and scrub. We passed
two or three palm-leaf cottages on our way; and here I noticed the first implement
of agriculture I saw in Borneo. It was a wooden harrow; and a native seeing me interested
in it, pointed to a rude iron-shod plough which hung in a large mango tree near one
of the huts.
</p>
<p>A good many of the people who live here are Badjows or &#x201c;sea gipsies,&#x201d; so called from
their habit of wandering about from place to place in boats, in which they seem more
thoroughly at home than in the wretched huts they now and then build on shore. They
are essentially lazy, and will not walk a yard if they can get a buffalo or anything
having four legs to carry them. We saw two Badjow boys going to the spring for water,
and they both rode on a buffalo calf, which seemed used to its mischievous load. We
returned to dinner at dusk, and managed to get a good night&#x2019;s rest here, as the houses
were cool, being built over the water, and the mosquitoes were not nearly so bloodthirsty
as usual.
</p>
<p>Our boat did not come round until nearly ten the following morning. We had been up
since sunrise, and had our breakfast; so, when our craft appeared, we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80">80</a>]</span>borrowed a boat and a couple of men from the Pangeran, and left for the Badjow village
on the Menkabong. We reached that place about noon in a drenching shower, and our
guides assured us that further progress that day was impossible. We therefore had
our things brought up into the head-house and soon made ourselves comfortable. We
had brought two dozen fine pomoloes with us from Labuan, and the ripe ones were now
really excellent in flavour; and we thoroughly enjoyed this delicious fruit for dessert
after a frugal luncheon of bread and dried fish. About four o&#x2019;clock the rain ceased,
and the sun shone beautifully, so we took our guns, and went ashore for an hour to
shoot. We secured a few pigeons and other birds, returning to dinner at sunset. Mr.
Veitch lost his watch among the long grass, but was fortunate enough to find it on
retracing his steps.
</p>
<p>We arose at day-break the following morning, and started off, reaching the market-place
on the Tamparulie plain about seven o&#x2019;clock. A large market of fruit, fish, vegetables,
rice, and other native produce, was being held, and on landing we met with the Datu
in whose village we had remained last night. We told him the object of our presence
in his territory, and found him agreeable, although not nearly so dignified as Pangeran
Rau. He sent off one of his men to fetch us some fruit, and he soon returned with
a basket of fine langsat, in return for which we gave him a couple of pomoloes, and
we afterwards smoked a cigar together while our men unloaded the boats. We tried to
hire two or three men from him; but as he was very extortionate in his demands as
to payment for them and a buffalo-sledge which we wished to load with rice for our
men, we cut the matter short by refusing his assistance at any price. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>We sent back the Pangeran&#x2019;s boat, and giving our men as much rice each as they could
carry, we returned the rest to the other boat and left two men in charge until our
return. I am inclined to think his greed was excited by seeing the cloth and goods
we had as the men unloaded the boat.
</p>
<p>We now found out the value of the man &#x201c;Musa,&#x201d; whom we had engaged to superintend our
men. He was an old man, but still powerful and active, and he possessed the secret
of persuasion to the utmost degree. Under his direction the men were all loaded equally,
and to their individual satisfaction, and we set off towards Tamparulie. We saw a
pretty white-flowered cucurbit growing over bushes here and there, and bearing spindle-shaped
fruits of a scarlet colour and about two inches long. Here and there also the red-berried
spikes of an amorphophallus were seen among the tall grass. I and Veitch shouldered
our guns, and pushed on across a low grassy plain inhabited for the time by a few
black water buffaloes, and then came a long march in single file across a series of
wet rice or padi fields, the paths through which were scarcely a foot broad, very
uneven, and being of pure clay, the last night&#x2019;s rain had made them as slippery as
wet soap. We who had only our guns to carry found it rather hard work floundering
about on the greasy tracks; but the men were in good spirits, and a march of about
two hours brought us to the Tawaran, close to the village of Tamparulie which stands
on its banks.
</p>
<p>The plain we had just traversed was well cultivated, and very fertile, rice, bananas,
cocoa-nut trees, and other vegetation being most luxuriant. Buffaloes were employed
to draw the rude ploughs through the rich, moist earth. We saw immense flocks of white
&#x201c;padi birds,&#x201d; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>and here and there a crane, majestically stalking among the crops. At our halting-place
the river is very shallow, its high banks being fringed with groves of cocoa-nuts
and bananas; and in one or two places I noted neatly-fenced and well-kept gardens
descending nearly to the water&#x2019;s edge. In these were sweet potatoes, cucumbers, maize,
and &#x201c;kaladi,&#x201d; or <i lang="la">Caladium esculentum</i>. The women seemed to be the principal cultivators of these little plots, and we could
see them at work among the garden crops here and there as we passed along.
</p>
<p>Here we noticed a lovely palm for the first time&#x2014;a caryota&#x2014;having dark green plumose
foliage, the pinnæ abruptly jagged, and notched along its margins. As we partook of
our luncheon, an intelligent old native came along, and sent our men to his garden,
which he pointed out to us, for some green cocoa-nuts, so that we obtained a delicious
draught, which we found very refreshing after our hot walk. He was very talkative,
and begged a little brandy; and he also gladly accepted the seeds of a fine pomolo
(<i lang="la">Citrus decumana</i>), to plant in his garden. We did not cross the stream here, but plunged on beside
the river, following a narrow, muddy buffalo track, which in places resembled a tunnel,
being completely embowered with tall grasses, bound together with large convolvuli
and other creeping and climbing plants.
</p>
<p>A heavy walk of a couple of hours brought us to the first group of Dusun houses, which
stood on a bit of rising ground close beside the stream, being surrounded by a grove
of cocoa-nut palms and other fruit-trees. We stayed here to rest our followers, and
while waiting shot several birds on the surrounding trees. Let not the gentle reader
blame us for wanton destruction! There <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>was &#x201c;method in our madness;&#x201d; we did not &#x201c;kill for sport,&#x201d; but only for the advancement
of learning, or for food.
</p>
<p>About half a mile beyond we came to a fording-place in the stream, and descending
the slippery clay banks, we crossed the river, which in places reached up to our waists;
and in one place the current was rather too strong to be pleasant. Beaching the other
side, our way lay along an abandoned bed of the stream for some distance. The old
shingly bed was in some places quite thickly covered with <i lang="la">Celosia argentea</i>, forming compact little bushes, two feet high, every branchlet terminated by a rose-tipped
spike of silvery bracts, forming, as seen here, a very pretty object.
</p>
<p>We reached the Dusan village of Bawang (<i>bawang</i>, in the Dusun dialect = river) about four o&#x2019;clock, after fording a creek up to our
necks, and indeed we were both tired and hungry. We took refuge in a house, which
stood on the bank, quite close to the river, and our men soon had several fires ablaze
on the pebbly beach below. We pulled off our wet things, and enjoyed a bath in the
bubbling stream, and then a nice rub, dry and clean clothes, made us quite comfortable
by dinner time. &#x201c;Bongsur,&#x201d; one of the bird hunters, brought in two or three very pretty
birds here; and Mr. Veitch added a black, red-bellied squirrel (&#x201c;basing&#x201d;) to our collection.
</p>
<p>We slept the sleep of the weary; and the following morning pushed on up the slope
beyond the village. The shady jungle through which we passed ere we began to ascend
was thickly carpeted with selaginellas, <i lang="la">S. Wallichii</i> being especially luxuriant. <i lang="la">S. caulescens</i> drooped from the moist rocks here and there very gracefully. We found the climbing
rather arduous work, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>and but for the shade of the overhanging bamboo, which grows here plentifully, we
should have fared worse.
</p>
<p>On reaching the crest of the hill, an altitude of say 800 feet, we got along better.
At this height we found our first nepenthes, a pretty green-pitchered form, swollen
below, and having a broad, flattened red rim to its mouth (<i lang="la">N. Phyllamphora</i>). We rested an hour on the top, but could procure no water, excepting a few drops
from the cut end of a climbing plant, which the natives call &#x201c;kalobit,&#x201d; and of which
they sometimes form rough cordage, by rending it into long strips. The juice of this
plant is intensely bitter; but the water which distilled itself slowly from the cut
end was quite pure and tasteless.
</p>
<p>We ascended about 1500 feet to-day, and the views from the summit of the range between
Bawang and Si Nilau were very satisfying, all the intervening country to the sea being
plainly visible, as well as the whole coast-line, as far as Gaya Bay. We walked along
quicker than usual, for the sky became very black, and it was evident that we should
soon have a drenching shower. Our guides had forgotten the way to Si Nilau, and so
there was nothing for it but to push on, in the hopes of meeting with a shelter by
the way.
</p>
<p>At length we suddenly came upon the site of a deserted village, and took shelter in
a hut&#x2014;a little better in repair than the rest&#x2014;while from the trees near both langsat
fruit and cocoa-nuts were procurable. Here we waited until the rain abated, when we
took up our quarters in the house of a Dusun man, near the site of the old village,
which had, as we afterwards heard, been deserted on account of the death of the headman.
</p>
<p>We had previously met our Dusun landlord about two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>miles from this village, in some patches of rice and gourds, but he had been too frightened
to answer our inquiries as to the route, and rushed down the hill just as the first
few drops&#x2014;big, heavy, solitary drops&#x2014;fell from the black rain-clouds over head. Fortunately,
I had struck the right road a few yards further on, and followed it up, when in turning
a rocky corner, where two roads merged into one, I came across the man again face
to face. He was so surprised at my sudden reappearance, that he fairly shook with
terror, and he rushed down the rocky ledge, which served as a path around the hill-top,
with the speed of a startled deer. I had yelled after him to stop, but he ran all
the faster; and when afterwards we entered his house, our men had a little trouble
to reassure him that we meant him no harm.

</div><p>
</p>
<p>We soon put the old boy at his ease, however; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>then a fowl for our dinner was caught and killed. For this and the fruit we had stolen
we paid him a fathom and a half of grey shirting, with which he was very pleased.
His house was a very neat one, having a large public room in front, with a stove,
hearth, or fire-place opposite the door, and two little sleeping rooms behind. Like
all Dusun houses the floor was elevated four feet from the ground, level on piles,
so that the pigs and fowls had shelter beneath. The side walls and floors were of
bamboo, beaten or pressed out flat, like boards, and being of a clear, yellow colour,
they had a warm and comfortable appearance as the fire glowed on the hearth, above
which was a rack for the storage of fire-wood, or on which clothes could be dried.
</p>
<p>After dinner we lit our lamp, and made ourselves as cosy as possible over our post-prandial
cigar, after which we were not loath to turn in. Up by daybreak, and snatching our
morning meal, we were soon <i>en route</i> for Kalawat Peak, and thence we descended to Kalawat village by a rocky mountain-path,
fringed with bamboos, large ginger-worts, and ferns of various kinds.
</p>
<p>A strong growing species of bauhinia was very showy here, overrunning the branches
of bushes and low trees beside the path, and bearing its pale, yellow flowers in large
clusters very profusely. As seen at a distance it has a pleasing effect in the landscape&#x2014;a
rare thing with Bornean flowers; and a nearer sight of it is suggestive of our native
woodbine.
</p>
<p>Selaginellas were plentiful near the streams, and near the crest of the Peak (alt.
2000 feet) we saw a dainty little bertolonia, rarely exceeding two inches in height,
having pearly-spotted leaves, and terminal clusters of rosy-pink flowers. A stately
habited nephrodium, with gracefully arching light-green fronds, nearly a yard <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>long, a zingiberad, with richly barred foliage (<i lang="la">Alpinia sp.</i>), two or three species of gleichenia, and now and then an inconspicuous epiphyte,
orchid, or fern occurred, to add variety to our route.
</p>
<p>We were puzzled to-day by seeing horizontal bamboo-stems fixed in the trees over our
path, but we eventually discovered that they were intended to serve as bridges or
paths to rats or other animals, traps being set to catch those who were unwary enough
to avail themselves of the convenient crossing.
</p>

</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>A curious custom of the Dusun is to entrap and eat the common field rats, wild cats,
&amp;c., of the country. Beside all the little paths through the forest, near Kina Balu,
wooden rat-traps (see Fig.) are set in the herbage through which the animals have
made their tracks. A form of this trap, slightly modified, is hung on the branches
of trees for the capture of squirrels and other fruit-eating <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>rodents. I asked Kurow how long the Dusun had eaten rats? His reply was that, &#x201c;Once
upon a time,&#x201d; a horde of rats, far more than ever followed the &#x2018;Pied Piper,&#x2019; I should
judge by his adjectives, came and ate up all the rice and kaladi. A conference was
held by the then reigning chief in the head house, and his advice was of the stern,
practical kind. &#x201c;Talking is of no use,&#x201d; said he; &#x201c;the rats have eaten all our rice:
we have no other food left to us; <i>ergo</i>, we must eat up the rats!&#x201d; &#x201c;And so it was, and is to this day,&#x201d; said Kurow; but I
fancied I could see a sly twinkle in his bright eyes&#x2014;just the same merry twinkle one
expects to see in anyone&#x2019;s face, after having related a palpably improbable story
with all due solemnity!
</p>
<p>We pass several very pretty little rills, at which drinking or washing was facilitated
by spouts, made of the leaf-stalk of the sago palm, and placed so as to conduct the
cool sparkling water on a level with one&#x2019;s face. Flourishing rice and kaladi fields
became more plentiful; and the tree ferns, which we had first sighted after leaving
Si Nilau, now became more numerous. Just ere we reached Kalawat, we noticed some splendid
specimens in the jungle; and now and then even out in the clearings their great crowns
of fresh green plumose fronds being fully exposed to the sun, and in some cases borne
aloft on slender black trunks, 20 feet or more in height. At the village of Kalawat
the houses are in one place backed by an immense grove of these feathery plumed tall
tree ferns, above which the white stemmed betel-nut palm towers aloft, its dark green
foliage and pendent clusters of bright orange fruit standing out clear and bright
against the cool blue sky.
</p>
<p>At Kalawat we rested awhile. The straggling dwellings <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89">89</a>]</span>were built on piles over the muddy ground, and a few ill-fed black pigs were rooting
up turf in all directions in quest of food. Here, for the first time, along this route,
we were pleased to see tame bees hived in sections of hollow tree trunks, about two
feet in length, the top and bottom being stopped up, and a hole burnt in the centre
as an entrance for the busy workers. In one or two cases separate little huts were
erected especially for the bees, but as a rule the hives were placed on a board beneath
the overhanging eaves of the houses. The kind of bee kept is very small, much smaller
than that common in England, and I was struck at the peculiar manner in which they
wriggled their bodies simultaneously as they congregated in groups on the hive near
the entrance. These tame bees, as well as their wild brethren, who nest in the tall
forest trees, make but little honey in proportion to that of our northern kinds, and
are especially kept for the wax they yield, this being used occasionally by the natives
in the form of rude candles, and it is also an article of export from Borneo.
</p>
<p>Being in advance of our followers we waited here an hour. It is a singular trait of
the Borneans to show no curiosity when strangers pass through their villages. We sat
here on a rock for some considerable time, and yet, not even the children came out
to look at us. Two men sitting outside on a verandah, basket-making, and an old woman,
were all the inhabitants we saw, but doubtless many a pair of bright eyes watched
us secretly through the cracks of the bamboo houses. As it came on to rain, however,
we entered one of the houses, in which were seven or eight young men and several women.
We tried to get some fruit here, but the langsat were not ripe, and <span class="corr" id="xd29e1367" title="Source: cocoanuts">cocoa-nuts</span> were scarce owing to the flowering stems being cut off and the exuding sap collected
in a bamboo vessel <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>to be made into toddy, a drink of which the hill villagers are very fond. At last
a couple of young nuts were forthcoming, and a dash of brandy in each gave us a most
refreshing draught. As the rain ceased, we decided to proceed to Bungol, the next
village along our route. To this one of our guides, Pangeran Raman of Labuan,&#x2014;an artful
old sweep&#x2014;loudly objected, urging that the Tawaran would be flooded&#x2014;that we should
not reach Bungol at all that night, as it would be dark long ere we could do so&#x2014;adding,
that there was no intervening resting-place. I was used to these excuses, and determined
to go on, to which Mr. Veitch also agreed. Our guides, who had come here from Si Nilau,
refused to go further, nor would any of the Kalawat people go to Bungol with us as
guides, but at last one of them pointed out the right road for us to take, and I and
Mr. Veitch set out along the rocky path alone. We rested on the hill above the village,
and then Pangeran Raman and our two servants, or &#x201c;boys,&#x201d; joined us, and said the men
refused to come on. This did not deter us, and we plunged down the hill-path and through
one or two clearings, in which sweet potatoes, maize, and tobacco grew luxuriantly.
Then down a greasy clay path, embowered with bamboos, tall canes and jungle, until
at last the Tawaran was reached in the valley below, rushing and boiling among the
smooth boulders in its bed.
</p>
<p>We sat on the banks of the stream to rest. Here a pretty little palm about a yard
high formed strong tufts and patches, its roots being laved by the stream below. Its
pinnate leaves were graceful, and had a distinct grassy appearance. Draping trees
close by the river <span class="corr" id="xd29e1374" title="Source: also we">we also</span> found a species of vanilla in bloom. It had large waxy flowers of a creamy white
colour, the lip having a five-lobed hairy crest of a dark purple-brown <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91">91</a>]</span>colour. As many as twenty buds were counted in a cluster, but the flowers expanded
one at a time. We crossed the river, which nowhere exceeded our knees in height, and
pushed on up the next hill. The mist was gathering thick and white in the valleys,
and it began to rain in torrents. In a very few minutes the path up the hill-side
became a brook, and the rain beat in our faces so that we could scarcely see our way.
Added to this inconvenience was the thought that we might not be in the right track,
and of this our worthy &#x201c;guide,&#x201d; Pangeran Raman, could tell us nothing. He was a very
good fair-weather traveller, and the biggest man in our party when all was well around
a good camp fire! At a pinch, when most wanted, he was perfectly useless&#x2014;indeed, in
the way. I am afraid I did not pity him as he stood shivering in the cold, and begging
piteously of us to return to a miserable little hut beside the river for the night.
This was out of the question, as we had not a dry thread on us and no food, so I pushed
up the hill to reconnoitre. Just at the top I met a Dusun man who had come from Bungol,
and who was going to Kalawat, and when Mr. Veitch and the old Pangeran came up, we
induced the native to return with us to Bungol. We now felt more at ease, and splashed
down the hill-side merrily, and after crossing the Tawaran four times, in one place
nearly to our necks, we reached the cocoanut-crested hill on which the village of
Bungol stands. Our &#x201c;boys&#x201d; had lagged behind and only reached the houses just before
night-fall, having been mainly guided by the accidental discharge of our guns, which
we had let off in order to dry them soon after our arrival. Our guide had brought
us to his own house, and we soon had a good fire, and took off our wet clothes, after
which we sat by the fire clad in native sarongs which our host lent us. We soon wrung
out our <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>clothes, and hung them on a beam over the blazing fire to dry, and then came the question
of dinner. At last we procured a fowl and a bowl of rice, and my Chinese &#x201c;boy,&#x201d; Kimjeck,
who was a good cook, soon had these on the fire.
</p>
<p>After it was dark we heard shouting, and soon after six of our men who carried the
food, clothes, and sleeping gear came in, being afraid, as they said, that we should
want food. We were soon all as jolly as sandboys. The fowl was cut up and boiled with
a tin of julienne soup and three or four chilies, and this and a nice white bowl of
steaming rice formed a dish which to us, tired and hungry as we were, seemed &#x201c;fit
for a king.&#x201d; A cup of chocolate and a cigar followed by way of dessert, and all our
troubles for the time being vanished in smoke! We paid our guide a fathom of grey
shirting, and gave him a looking-glass for our night&#x2019;s lodging. The fowl and a couple
of cocoanuts also were paid for with a fathom of shirting, and everybody was thus
easily satisfied.
</p>
<p>Having only a sleeping-rug each, we found it rather chilly, and I could not sleep
well. I rose about 11 o&#x2019;clock, however, and made up a good fire, and then lay down
beside it and slept well until daybreak. We had breakfasted in the morning and were
outside ready to start, when our laggards of yesterday came in, and they looked sheepish
and crestfallen when they found that we were really about to start on and had not
intended to have awaited their coming. Two Dusun men now accompanied us as guides,
and after crossing the Tawaran several times, we mounted the hill to the left, crossing
the ridge and descending towards Koung. The way to the village was down rocky gutters
seemingly worn by heavy rains, and the hill-side paths in the kaladi gardens <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93">93</a>]</span>were very bad to traverse, and we were thoroughly tired out ere we reached the grassy
flat on which Koung is built, indeed, this was the most toilsome day&#x2019;s work we had
hitherto had, although, perhaps, our long tramp yesterday had something to do with
its being so.
</p>
<p>We found the Koung people peaceably inclined, although we did not forget that it was
here that Mr. Low and St. John had some difficulty with the natives the first time
they came this way. We slept well, and in the morning after breakfast we retraced
our steps by the river to examine a scarlet flower which we had seen from the opposite
bank yesterday. It turned out to be <i lang="la">Bauhinia Kochiana</i>, or an allied species. Mr. Veitch shot a fine white-headed hawk, which was on the
look out for a breakfast of fresh fish from the river. We also secured several other
birds we had not before seen. The red-fruited <i lang="la">Rubus rosæfolius</i> was very pretty here among the rocks, and we observed one or two orchids of interest
on the trees overhanging the stream. The river is very pretty as it passes the village,
and as the water comes from the hills above, it is deliciously clear and cool, quite
a luxury, in fact, either for drinking or bathing. We enjoyed our morning ramble,
and on returning to the house wherein we had slept we found all the men ready to start
for Kiau. On our crossing the ford at the end of the village we met a large party
of natives laden with baskets of tobacco and a little beeswax, going on a trading
expedition. There were some women among them, who, of course, carried the heaviest
loads. Several of the men were tattooed on the breast and arms, and all were armed
with brass-handled parongs and slender-shafted spears. They showed no surprise at
seeing us, and passed on apparently unconcerned as to our object. Our way now lay
up the valley, first on the right and then on the left <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>of the river, but there was no great difficulty in crossing, the water being rarely
as high as the hips. We passed huts here and there, and irrigated patches of rice.
Maize and sweet potatoes grew around the houses, and almost all had a clump of big-leaved
bananas near the door. The rice land was irrigated by a ditch cut from the river,
a little dam being made so as to direct the water into it as required. We noticed
several fish-traps set in the river to-day. These are made of a bamboo stem six feet
long, split lengthwise and made into a long basket-like shape with rattans, so that
it is wide at top and narrow at the other end. In order to set them effectively, an
oblique dam of stones and earth is made so as to direct a large body of water through
an aperture, and in this the basket is placed. A fish once washed into it has no chance
of escape, and large quantities are caught at times, especially after the river is
freshened by rains. Occasionally we saw men or women working on the rice-land, and
I was very much struck at the care taken in planting and cultivating the crop, not
a weed being anywhere visible in the rice-patches. The planting was extremely regular,
each tuft or stool being about eight inches from its neighbours, so that all obtained
their due amount of earth, light, and air, a lesson indeed for some of our own cultivators
of cereals here at home.
</p>
<p>We passed immense clumps of bamboo, the feathery wands rising in masses to a height
of fifty or sixty feet. From one of these clumps our men secured some of the young
crowns, which are white and tender, and by no means despisable as a vegetable when
boiled with salt. At Bawang I had noticed them eating boiled fern-tops with their
rice, and on asking for a little I was surprised at its delicate spinach-like flavour.
We met a boy at one of the crossings with a basket of fine langsat fruit, some of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>which we purchased, giving him a Chinese looking-glass in exchange.
</p>
<p>At length, crossing the river for the last time, we rested in the shade of a huge
sandstone rock for a luncheon of cold rice and fruit. Our path then lay to the left
through low jungle, and on one or two of the old remaining trees we noticed masses
of <i lang="la">Grammatophyllum speciosum</i> with stems eight feet in length&#x2014;each plant a good cartload, and evidently in the
most luxuriant health, with foliage fresh and green, although fully exposed to the
hot sun. C&#x153;logynes were plentiful on the lower trees and rocks by the river. One sandstone
boulder was entirely covered with <i lang="la">Davallia ciliata</i>, and some fine tall grasses grew among the pebbles of the old river bed. The rocks
bordering the river are of sandstone, and yet at Koung and along our route to-day
we continually met with boulders of granite sometimes in the present river bed, sometimes
on the old dry bed, and sometimes, as on the green Koung, immense pieces, a hundred
tons weight, lie isolated on the plain. Half an hour&#x2019;s walk from our resting-place
by the river brought us to the clearings and the hill or dry rice-fields of the Kiau
villagers. The crop was ripening fast, and the whole hill-side, as well as the one
opposite beyond the river, looked very flourishing. Here and there were green patches
of kaladi, and around the field-huts of bamboo, cucumbers clustered, and sweet potatoes,
maize, and occasionally bananas, looked prosperous. We followed a narrow footpath
through the rice, which was kept from injury by a little fence of bamboo, and in places
the earth was prevented from washing down by a few large stones laid in line. We reached
the village about two o&#x2019;clock, the journey from Koung having taken us about five hours.
The people here did seem to feel more interest than ordinary, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96">96</a>]</span>and we soon had a tolerably good audience around us. One by one our followers came
in, and we soon availed ourselves of the comfort of a rub over with a towel and dry
clothes, after which we arranged the various plants collected during the day, and
continued our journals. &#x201c;Bongsur&#x201d; brought in a fine brown owl and a pretty scarlet
bird with black wing-tips, neither of which we had seen before. For dinner we had
boiled fowl and rice, followed by coffee and a cigarette of native tobacco wrapped
in maize-husk. We lay on our mats and rugs at one end of the large public room, all
our men being cooking and jabbering away to their hearts&#x2019; content, the Babel of sounds,
partly Malay and partly Dusun, being deafening. Tobacco was brought in for sale soon
after our arrival, and one man brought a fowl, but as he asked double its value we
refused to buy it.
</p>

</div><p>
</p>
<p>The greatest interest was shown in all we did, more <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97">97</a>]</span>especially by the boys and young girls who crowded on the pathway just in front of
where we lay. When we extinguished our lamp and turned into our blankets they soon
became quiet, the people of the house retiring to their private apartments, and the
others to their houses in the village. It was a wet night, and we felt chilly, but
slept well. Our first task after breakfast in the morning was to overhaul all our
stores, arranging those we wanted on the mountain so that they could be easily carried,
and packing the rest so that they could be left with safety. Our stock of rice was
so low that we were rather alarmed, but &#x201c;Musa&#x201d; assured us that he should be able to
buy some in the village. After re-arranging all our things, we took our guns and walked
over the hill. We saw very few birds, nor were the plants we discovered of any particular
interest, with the exception of a large white-flowered arundina, having a rich amethyst-coloured
lip. We saw some immense <span class="corr" id="xd29e1418" title="Source: gingerworts">ginger-worts</span>, having leafy stems ten or twelve feet in height; also large ferns of the angiopteris
type, while <i lang="la">Mikania volubilis</i> overran the bushes along our route.
</p>
<p>Returning to the house, we engaged Boloung and Kurow, the acting head men of the village,
and six of their followers, to take us up the mountain on the morrow. &#x201c;Musa&#x201d; and Pangeran
Raman did most of the bargaining on our side, and at length concluded the matter by
paying over the amount of cloth and brass wire as agreed. Next morning we selected
sixteen of our men and started for the mountain. In a rich bit of shady forest on
the other side of the Kiau ridge we found the evergreen <i lang="la">Calanthe macroloba</i>, bearing spikes of white flowers much larger individually than those of <i lang="la">C. veratrifolia</i>. A foliage plant marked with silvery blotches above and crimson beneath was also
collected. Our road was a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>rough and tiring one of sloping <span class="corr" id="xd29e1434" title="Source: hillside">hill-side</span> paths very wet and slippery, and in places blocked by fallen trees. About one o&#x2019;clock
we reached a rushing stream, and our guides brought us to a large overhanging rock,
where they said we must pass the night. It now began to rain heavily, so we at once
told the men to cut sticks and palm-leaves to lay on the ground where we were to sleep,
and over which we could spread our waterproof sheets and rugs. This was soon done,
and meanwhile our &#x201c;boys&#x201d; prepared luncheon. We were disgusted at stopping thus early
in the day, and wished our guides to proceed when the rain abated, which however they
determinedly refused to do. To make the best of a bad bargain, I and Mr. Veitch explored
the forest above our camp, where we found a pretty aroid with white blotched leaves,
and another marbled with silvery grey; also a variegated plant resembling an anæctochilus,
but which Professor Reichenbach tells me is the <i lang="la">Cystorchis variegata</i> of Blume. This plant I had previously gathered in another locality further south;
indeed, it seems pretty generally distributed along the north-west coast. Specimens
of two or three delicate filmy ferns were found near the streams; and at our camping-place,
which we named the &#x201c;Sleeping Rock,&#x201d; the pretty little <i lang="la">Adiantum diaphanum</i> was plentiful, and living plants were brought to England from this habitat.
</p>
<p>About seven o&#x2019;clock next morning we started on our upward journey. It was hot work
at first, but we could feel it perceptibly get cooler after the first two or three
thousand feet. At about four thousand feet mosses are very plentiful, the finest species
gathered being <i lang="la">Dawsonia superba</i>, which fringed the path, but nowhere in great plenty. A new white-flowered species
of burmannia was also gathered, and small-flowered orchids were seen. In <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99">99</a>]</span>one place a shower of small scarlet rhododendron flowers covered the ground at our
feet, the plant being epiphytal in the trees overhead. It was very misty, and the
moss which covered every rotten stick, and the vegetation generally, was dripping
with moisture, and every sapling we grasped in climbing upwards was the means of shaking
a shower-bath on us from the trees above. At about five thousand feet a dead and broken
pitcher of <i lang="la">Nepenthes Lowi</i> lying in the path led to the discovery of the plant itself scrambling among the mossy
branches overhead, its singular flagon-shaped ascidia hanging from the point of every
leaf. It is a vigorous-habited plant, with bright green leathery leaves, the petioles
of which clasp the stem in a peculiar manner. The only plants we saw were epiphytal
on mossy trunks and branches, and we searched for young plants diligently, but without
success. All the pitchers hitherto seen are cauline ones, and as the plant has never
yet been seen in a young state, it is an open question as to whether the radical pitchers
differ in shape or size, as is the case with most other species. As we ascended higher,
epiphytal orchids, especially erias, dendrochilia, and c&#x153;logynes became more plentiful,
and we came upon a large-flowered rhododendron, bearing rich orange flowers two inches
in diameter, and twenty flowers in a cluster! It grew on a dangerous declivity, and
not one of our lazy men would venture to get it for us. Such a prize, however, was
too lovely to forego, and after a wet scramble among the surrounding bushes, I secured
it in good condition. Two or three other species were seen in flower, but none equal
to it in its golden beauty. Casuarina trees became common, and higher up these were
joined by two or three species of gleichenias, and a distinct form of dipteris. Phyllocladus
also appeared, and a glaucus-leaved dianella (<i lang="la">D. javanica</i>). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100">100</a>]</span>Here also were two of the most distinct of all rhododendrons, <i lang="la">R. ericifolium</i> and <i lang="la">R. stenophyllum</i>. On open spaces among rocks and sedges, the giant <i lang="la">Nepenthes Rajah</i> began to appear, the plants being of all sizes, and in the most luxuriant health
and beauty. The soil in which they grew was a stiff yellow loam, surfaced with sandstone-grit,
and around the larger plants a good deal of rich humus and leaf <span class="corr" id="xd29e1469" title="Source: debris"><i>débris</i></span> had collected. The long red-pitchered <i lang="la">N. Edwardsiana</i> was seen in two places. This plant, like <i lang="la">N. Lowii</i>, is epiphytal in its perfect state, and is of a slender rambling habit. Highest of
all in the great nepenthes zone came <i lang="la">N. villosa</i>, a beautiful plant, having rounded pitchers of the softest pink colour, with a crimson
frilled orifice, similar to that of <i lang="la">N. Edwardsiana</i>. All thoughts of fatigue and discomfort vanished as we gazed on these living wonders
of the Bornean Andes! Here, on this cloud-girt mountain side, were vegetable treasures
which Imperial Kew had longed for in vain. Discovered by Mr. Low in 1851, dried specimens
had been transmitted by him to Europe, and Dr. (now Sir Joseph) Hooker had described
and illustrated them in the Transactions of the Linnæan Society, but all attempts
to introduce them alive into European gardens had failed. To see these plants in all
their health and vigour was a sensation I shall never forget&#x2014;one of those which we
experience but rarely in a whole lifetime!
</p>
<p>We reached the cave (altitude 9,000 feet) about three o&#x2019;clock, wet and hungry, but
far from unhappy. Our first care was to light a fire, which was not at all easy to
do, since everything was dripping wet. We secured a bit of dry wood at last, however,
and by whittling thin shavings from it with a knife, we managed to start a good fire,
and some of the men were directed to cut firewood; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101">101</a>]</span>but so paralysed were they by the wet and cold, that it was with the greatest difficulty
that we could persuade them to do this. Poor old &#x201c;Musa&#x201d; cut some wood and made a floor
to the cave, after which some brushwood and leaves formed a substitute for a mattress.
The next difficulty was to obtain water, since the men we had sent to search for it
returned empty handed, having failed to find any. As a last resort I had to undertake
this duty myself, and, descending the hill-side, I found a tiny pool in a gully, from
which I procured a little in our cook-pots. It was not near enough, however; and in
wandering in search of more, I came upon a patch of the large nepenthes, from the
old pitchers of which I was able to augment my supply by carefully pouring off the
rain water from a rather liberal under stratum of flies, ants, and other insect <i>débris</i>. Our guides slept under a rock a little further on and higher up the mountain side,
and they found a stream from which good water was procured by our men in the morning
and during our stay here.
</p>
<p>It commenced to rain heavily at nightfall, and we found it very cold, although we
kept a good fire burning nearly all night, one of the results being that we were nearly
blinded by the smoke, there being a draught towards an opening at the hinder part
of the cave. The wet dripped from the roof all night, and the walls were also wet
and slimy; indeed our quarters were neither extensive nor luxurious; still we made
the best of them, and, after all, were rather sorry to leave them at last. We arose
at daybreak to collect plants and roots, in the which we were tolerably successful;
and before night we had secured all our collections in baskets and bundles ready for
the men to carry down. It was very cool and misty in the morning, but about noon it
became clearer, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>and it was hot indeed, the rocks and old trunks reeked in the sunshine. A slender-growing
species of calamus was very common in the low forest below the cave, and it supplied
&#x201c;rattans&#x201d; of excellent quality for tying up our plants. At least three showy species
of c&#x153;logyne grow on the rocks and mossy banks here, at 9,000 feet elevation; and a
dainty little plant with reddish pseudo-bulbs in clusters, each bearing a single spathulate
dark green leaf, is common. This last has erect spikes of pure white flowers and buds,
reminding one of the lily of the valley in cool, fresh purity, an effect partly due
to its column being of a soft green tint, like a speck in the interior of the blossom.
The c&#x153;logynes are very distinct and beautiful as seen here blooming among the coarse
sedges and shrubs. One has white flowers with a blotch of gold on the lip, eight or
ten of its waxy flowers being borne on an erect scape. Another has yellow sepals and
petals, and a white lip corrugated with brown warts. Another, not so showy, has a
nodding spike of white and brown flowers.
</p>
<p>We ascended about 9,000 feet, and were delighted with the charming views obtainable
during clear weather. The whole upper portion of the mountain along the south and
south-eastern slopes is nearly devoid of vegetation, except where there are streams
and rather sheltered gullies up which the stunted trees and a few other plants struggle
up near to the summit. On the north-western side the rocks rise very precipitous;
and here vegetation fails to gain foothold. Looking upwards in the early sunlight,
we had clear views of the shelving granite slopes, on which are numerous shallow channels
down which streams of water pour during misty and rainy weather. When we gained the
top of the great spur the morning after our arrival at the cave, we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103">103</a>]</span>were delighted at the immense panorama which lay at our feet as we looked back. Looking
away south-west we beheld the coast-line from the mouth of what our guides said was
the Tampassuk river right down to Gaya Bay and Pulo Tiga, which was distinctly visible,
the many-mouthed Menkabong river glistening like a silver net quite close to the <span class="corr" id="xd29e1499" title="Source: coast line">coast-line</span>.
</p>
<p>Looking south-east over a billowy sea of silvery clouds we saw a gigantic range of
mountains, and from this the conical peak of Tilong rises through strata after strata
of cloud, or stands out on a clear blue background of pure sky, according to the state
of the atmosphere. This claims our interest as the beacon of a land unknown; and this
magnificent peak, Tilong, is by repute as high, or even higher, than Kina Balu itself.
Altogether we spent three days on the sides of Kina Balu collecting plants, flowers,
and seeds; and after a life on the plains and among the coast mountains&#x2014;hills compared
with this grisly giant&#x2014;we found the climate most deliciously cool and invigorating.
Rain generally commenced about 3 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, and continued until eight, the remainder of the night being clear, bright if moonlight,
and cool&#x2014;so cool, indeed, as to make a good camp fire and woollen shirts two or three-fold
and blankets very desirable. The mornings were generally misty, every leaf and branch
dripping with the rain and heavy dews common here at night, especially during the
wet season. About noon the sun was warm, and the temperature at 9,000 feet rises to
<span class="corr" id="xd29e1507" title="Source: 758">75°</span> if the day is fine and dry.
</p>
<p>As I have elsewhere said, our Malay followers suffered much from what to them was
bitter cold; indeed they seemed perfectly helpless, with scarcely energy to make a
fire and cook their food. They have no notion of actively bestirring themselves in
order to keep warm. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>Our food supply, too,&#x2014;that is, the rice&#x2014;ran short, and so the men were reduced to
live on kaladi and sweet potatoes roasted in the embers and eaten with a little salt.
Our Dusan guides also complained of the cold, and tried to hurry us in our descent;
indeed at last they would wait no longer, and they slipped away, leaving us to reach
their village alone as best we could. We were fully determined not to be defeated
in our object, however, and keeping ahead of our own men we descended leisurely so
as to gather plants by the way, until all had as much as they could possibly carry
down. I carried my servant&#x2019;s load in order that he might carry a lot of rare specimens
which I had secured for him in a handkerchief. The descent after the rain of the night
before was difficult and dangerous, and we had a good many falls. Once I fell down
a steep place a depth of about twenty feet, among shrubs and creepers, which saved
me from serious injury. Mr. Veitch and myself, my &#x201c;boy,&#x201d; and a solitary Labuan man,
went on a-head of our main party, and just at nightfall discovered that we had lost
our way. The right path lay across a clearing down which we turned instead of pushing
across and striking the path beyond.
</p>
<p>We floundered along in the gloaming down several dangerous steeps and across a rocky
stream, in crossing which I stepped incautiously on a slippery water-worn boulder,
and became thoroughly submerged in the water, which being from the heights above is
icy cold, at least it seems so after one has been used to the heat of the tropics.
This increased my discomfort, and poor Mr. Veitch was but little better. Here we were
at dark lost and benighted beside the rocky declivities of this mountain stream; but
there was no help for it; and after vainly trying to strike a path, we gave up at
the base of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105">105</a>]</span>a large tree, and putting down our burdens, we resolved to pass the night here. To
mend matters, it commenced to rain heavily about seven o&#x2019;clock, and I am afraid we
were not so happy as the mere possession of health and strength ought to have made
us. We had no food except a couple of wet biscuits and about half a glass of brandy
in a flask. These we shared, and perhaps they were sweeter than the choicest viands
would have tasted had we been in dress clothes and in comfortable quarters. Then Mr.
Veitch had a great find in his bag&#x2014;a couple of cigars and a box of matches. Sitting
in the smoking-room of a comfortable club, or in the billiard-room at home, one may
smile at such a discovery; but, situated as we were, cold and wet, a cigar added much
to our comfort. Our two followers tried to make a little shelter from the rain for
themselves, but failed miserably.
</p>
<p>About ten o&#x2019;clock the rain ceased, and we then tried to improve our position; for
hitherto all we could do was to walk about around a large tree&#x2014;a distance of a few
yards only; for in the darkness we knew not what ugly falls might not await us if
we strayed from our wretched camping-ground, which was wet and spongy under foot;
and the leeches crawled up our legs and bled us to their hearts&#x2019; content. We noticed
luminous fungi on the rotten sticks at our feet glowing quite brightly, and the effect
was weird and ghostly in the extreme. My &#x201c;boy,&#x201d; quite by accident, had placed a couple
of dry flannel shirts, a pair of trowsers, and a blanket, in the other man&#x2019;s basket,
and so, after the rain ceased, I was able to put on a dry warm shirt and trowsers,
a luxury I had not expected, and also to give Mr. Veitch a dry shirt and a share of
my rug. We now sat down on some brushwood, and leaning back against the tree, fell
asleep, and we did not wake until near sunrise. Thus ended <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106">106</a>]</span>one of the most dreary nights I ever spent in the Bornean woods.
</p>
<p>In the morning we retraced our steps across the rocky stream, and soon struck the
right path for Kiau, but we had not gone far before we met &#x201c;Kurow,&#x201d; the chief of our
runaway guides, in a great state of excitement, coming in search of us. He brought
us some fine langsat fruit in his bag&#x2014;presumably a peace offering&#x2014;and seemed rather
surprised that we did not chide him for his desertion of the day before. As we arrived
nearer the village we came across our men, armed with muskets, also in search of us,
and the hilltop was covered with Kiau people, who appeared greatly concerned, and
doubtless glad to see us safe and well.
</p>
<p>When we reached the house, everybody seemed glad to see our safe return, and sweet
potatoes, maize, rice, and kaladi, were readily brought in by the villagers for ourselves
and our men. &#x201c;Musa&#x201d; and the rest of our followers had arrived at Kiau soon after dark
the night before. One man brought a basket of excellent langsat fruit, and a woman
gave us two beautiful oranges from a tree near her door. They were quite yellow, with
tender skins and sweet pulp, similar to those of the south of Europe, not green skinned,
with tough desepiments, as are those of Labuan. I was much surprised at the oranges
having grass-green skins when perfectly ripe in Singapore, and even the brittle skinned
Mandarin variety had this peculiarity.
</p>
<p>Our guide, &#x201c;Kurow,&#x201d; was twitted pretty much by his neighbours for having left us the
day before, and at last he retired to his house evidently not well pleased with himself,
and, I believe, not a little surprised at our treating the matter so lightly.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107">107</a>]</span></p>
<p>We went out to a shady spot near the house to examine our plants and see that they
were in good order, and we then rested all day. We were not altogether satisfied with
our trip to the mountain, and resolved to start off to it again in the morning, but
this time taking another path so as to reach the &#x201c;Marie Parie&#x201d; spur. We sent off for
&#x201c;Kurow,&#x201d; and, telling him our intentions, asked him to collect his followers and be
in readiness to accompany us. The poor fellow was delighted at this sign of our confidence
in him, and helped us zealously, enduring cold, rain, and waiting&#x2014;to him meaningless,
weary waiting&#x2014;without a murmur. In the morning we crossed the hill behind the village,
and fording the &#x201c;Haya-Haya,&#x201d; &#x201c;Dahombang,&#x201d; &#x201c;Pino-Kok,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Kina Takie&#x201d; streams, we
reached the foot of the &#x201c;Marie Parie&#x201d; spur.
</p>
<p>Now came a climb up a rocky pathway, besides which we noticed fine plants of <i lang="la">Cypripedium Petreianum</i>, <i lang="la">Cystorchis variegata</i>, and a lovely yellow flowered terrestrial orchid belonging to the genus <i lang="la">Spathoglottis</i>, but quite distinct from <i lang="la">S. aurea</i>. As we ascended, our path lay up through a belt <span class="corr" id="xd29e1543" title="Source: oftall">of tall</span> bamboos, and here two species of nepenthes were seen. One was the long, green pitchered
kind, covered with purple blotches (<i lang="la">N. Boschiana var. Lowii</i>), and the other a tall growing species, bearing beautiful white pitchers, elegantly
ewer-shaped, diaphanous like &#x201c;egg shell&#x201d; porcelain, and most daintily blotched with
reddish crimson in a way quite unlike any other variety. This grew on both sides of
the path, and climbed the trees to a height of forty or fifty feet. We reached the
crest of the ridge about three o&#x2019;clock, in a heavy drenching shower, the climate being
similar to that of a warm autumn evening in a Devonshire wood. We slept under some
overhanging rocks at an elevation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>of about 4,000 feet, having an under stratum of sticks and brushwood to keep our water-proof
sheets off the wet ground. The air, even at this low elevation, was chilly during
the night, and we found a fire and blankets acceptable comforts. <i lang="la">Melastoma macrocarpa</i>, bearing its large, rosy flowers, formed a large proportion of the brush around our
camping ground. Here the large nepenthes were very fine; and a beautiful white flowered
dendrobium grows among the bushes. It belongs to the nigro hirsute section, and has
pseudo-bulbs five or six feet high. The blossoms are described by Mr. Low as being
similar to those of <i lang="la">D. formosum giganteum</i>, but with a deep orange red blotch on the lip.
</p>
<p>Just above our camping ground, the long, red, pitchered <i lang="la">Nepenthes Edwardsiana</i> was very beautiful, growing up through the low jungle, its pitchers contrasting with
the tufts of rich green moss which draped trunks and branches everywhere. <i lang="la">N. Rajah</i> was also abundant; and we noticed some immense urns depending from its great broad
leaves, far finer, indeed, than those found at 9,000 feet elevation, on the more southern
spur. That distinct and curious fern, <i lang="la">Lindsaya Jamesonioides</i>, grew here and there in the chinks of the serpentine rock, and a long-leaved insect-catching
sundew (<i lang="la">Drosera</i>) was common in most places among the stones and herbage.
</p>
<p>After collecting what plants we desired, we had breakfast, and then commenced our
return. We reached Kiau in about five hours, but some of our men did not come in until
long after our arrival, as they had heavy loads to carry, and the clay paths were
very slippery. At Kiau village, and on the slopes of the mountain itself, we spent
eight days, and then came the weary march back to Gaya Bay, which, however, we accomplished
in six <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109">109</a>]</span>days. When we reached the Datu&#x2019;s village, he gave us a fine goat, which our &#x201c;boys&#x201d;
promptly slew for dinner, and, being young, it had a delicate mutton-like flavour,
and we thought it a great treat after our hard fare.
</p>
<p>A present of a revolver and some cartridges delighted our host; and the next morning,
having obtained another boat, and loaded the one we had, we pulled to Pangeran Rau&#x2019;s
place, where we hired a prahu, and two days afterwards reached Labuan safely.
</p>
<p>During our journey to and from the mountain, we met occasional parties of natives
from the far interior on their trading excursions, the women, as a matter of course,
carrying the heaviest loads, while the men carried nothing, save a little food in
a bag behind them, and their arms. Some had buffaloes with them. The women, as a class,
are strong and healthy, with small hands and feet, and well-proportioned features&#x2014;indeed,
in many cases, the young girls are very pleasing in face and figure, and have lovely
black hair, and the brightest of expressive black eyes. Early marriages, childbearing,
hard labour, and exposure in the fields, however, soon make shrivelled leather-skinned
old hags of them. Their drapery is nothing worth mentioning, and in such a climate
but little is required. Their manners are gentle and dignified&#x2014;often when we met them
quite suddenly they showed no surprise, even though they had never seen a white man
before. They make affectionate wives, and tender mothers&#x2014;indeed, I never saw a child
beaten or chided roughly during my stay in the island.
</p>
<p>In the capital and elsewhere on the coast, young Malay women are almost invariably
kept secluded from the gaze of strangers; but here among these hills inland, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110">110</a>]</span>as elsewhere among the aboriginals proper, we found the women enjoying perfect freedom
with the men.
</p>
<p>While staying at these villages, all the women and girls flocked to see us, and watched
us eat and drink with evident interest. The young girls were especially confident,
and formed laughing groups around us, chatting to each other in low, modulated tones,
and evidently comparing notes on their observations. They frequently brought us little
presents of fruit, and eggs, or fowls, and were delighted with the needles and thread,
looking-glasses, and white cloth which we gave them in return. Some of the younger
girls were much handsomer than the Malays, and stood lovingly together as they quizzed
us, often resting their plump little arms or their cheeks on each other&#x2019;s necks or
shoulders as they watched our every movement.
</p>
<p>Looking-glasses were considered fashionable at the time of our visit, and we could
have disposed of many more with advantage had we had them with us. Combs were not
so desirable, since these are made by their husbands or sweethearts; and they are
often very prettily decorated with carved work.
</p>
<p>Some of the men seem &#x201c;thoroughly domesticated,&#x201d; and I saw them affectionately nursing
their naked little babies at night, or in the daytime, while mamma had gone to the
field for food, or the forest for fuel. I particularly noticed the younger married
men standing behind their nice little wives at night when we were at dinner. They
folded their brown arms around their necks, and whispered loving gossip into their
ears, evidently well contented with themselves and with each other; and, perhaps,
their love is as real and as ardent and as true here as it is in high places where
dress clothes are worn. The farther one travels, the more plainly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111">111</a>]</span>does one see how deep rooted and how world-wide are all the springs of human feeling,
whether of love and joy, or death and sadness; in every land and in every breast is
written the great truth, &#x201c;One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>One night after dinner a bevy of dusky beauties had gathered around our mats, and
to afford some amusement, I showed them several <i lang="fr">carte de visite</i> portraits of friends which I had with me. They were particularly interested in that
of one lady, and examined it very attentively; not a bead or button escaped their
quick eyes; but they soon began asking questions. Was she married? How many children
had she? Was she a good wife? I asked what they meant by the last question. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d;
they answered, &#x201c;did she bring plenty of firewood and kaladi in? and could she clean
padi (rice) well?&#x201d; Thus a woman among these thrifty villagers earns her good name
as a wife by her capacity for physical labour. This is also so among other savage
races. The Indian girls on the north-west coast of North America in like manner endeavour
to excel each other in the quantity of quamash (<i lang="la">Camassia esculenta</i>) roots they collect, their fame as future good wives depending on their activity
in the Quamash plains. They were much interested in all particulars of dress as shown
by the <i>carte</i>; but one girl regretted the absence of rattan coils around the stomach and &#x201c;chawats&#x201d;
of thick brass wire on the wrists, and more to the like effect, all from the Kiau
standpoint&#x2014;for Kiau and its simple fashions are held to be inviolable. Kiau is all
the world to them!
</p>
<p>The morning we left, I believe all were sorry to part with us, and they came to the
top of the hill to see us off. On loading our men, we found that we had four <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112">112</a>]</span>men&#x2019;s loads of plants more than our men could carry, and so we engaged some of the
Kiau villagers to carry them for us as far as Bawang. We had a good deal of talking,
and a grand display of red cloth and brass wire on the hillside, but eventually &#x201c;Musa&#x201d;
concluded the bargain, and paid over the goods in advance, as is the general custom
here.
</p>
<p>After receiving the goods, they coolly told us they should not go on with us, as we
walked very slow, but that they would start next day, adding, that they should reach
Bawang before we did. We showed no signs of wishing otherwise, but passed on with
our followers, after having told the Kiau men to water the plants well as they crossed
the streams, and to protect them from the sun by means of large leaves, all of which
they did; and when we reached Bawang, there, sure enough, were our plants, all safe
and in good condition.
</p>
<p>After reaching Labuan, both Mr. Veitch and myself had bad attacks of intermittent
fever, the result of chilling exposure in wet clothes, and ill-cooked food, accompanied
by more than ordinary exertions. Fortunately our long and difficult journey had been
interrupted by nothing serious, and we were glad to see our native followers safe
home again. Certainly one of them had a nasty fall from a rocky path near Bawang and
cut his head badly, but he was a plucky Brunei man, and soon overgot his trouble.
Another of our fellows who had been trusted with a musket tried to fire it off after
he had blocked up the barrel by pushing it into the ground accidentally! He succeeded
in exploding the thing, and one of the fragments cut open his forehead, while another
piece struck one of the bird-hunters on the arm. No serious damage was done. The road
from Gaya Bay to Koung is so hilly and difficult for loaded men to traverse, that
I determined <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113">113</a>]</span>that if ever I went to Kina Balu again I would take the Tampassuk route. This I did
on a subsequent occasion, but during the wet season, when fording, the swollen rivers
presented great difficulties and dangers. During the dry season, or say, in January
or February, this route would be by far the best to follow.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Labuan is one of the smallest and least well known of all British Colonies.
</p>
<p>This island was ceded to Great Britain by the Sultan of Borneo in 1847, and the year
afterwards a settlement was established here, the late Sir James Brooke, <abbr title="Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath">K.C.B.</abbr>, being the first governor. Its area is 19,350 acres, and it is situated in lat. 5°
20&#x2032; N., being about six miles off the nearest point of Borneo, and about 700 miles
from Singapore. When ceded it was uninhabited and very unhealthy, but now contains
about 5,000 inhabitants, mostly Kadyans and Malays, and by clearing and draining the
climate is improved. The principal traders and artificers are Chinese. Chinese coolies
are imported as labourers. A few Klings or Bengalees also live here. The main object
of the colony was the suppression of piracy once rife along the coast, and the working
of the coal measures which exist at the northern point of the island. The quality
of the coal obtainable here is very good, but the output hitherto has been comparatively
small, owing to a series of adverse circumstances. At present the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115">115</a>]</span>mines are deserted, the company having discontinued mining operations. There is a
good harbour at the only town, Victoria, and this place forms a convenient coaling
station for <abbr title="Her Majesty&#x2019;s">H.M.</abbr> gunboats on the China station, which cruise in these seas. The trade is mainly in
the hands of the Chinese, who purchase the native products of Borneo, Palawan, and
the Sulu Archipelago, which is brought hither in native prahus or boats. Some of the
traders also make voyages to different parts of the Bornean coast to collect sago,
gutta, beeswax, edible swallows&#x2019; nests, camphor, trepang or beche de mer, mother-o&#x2019;-pearl
shell, and other produce, in return for which they barter cloth or cotton goods, opium
and tobacco, muskets, ammunition, gongs, and crockeryware, spirits, tea and provisions,
mostly derived from Singapore. The ss. &#x201c;Cleator&#x201d; carries the mails and most of the
imports and exports between Singapore and this port, and affords the only regular
means of transport. This vessel makes the voyage between Labuan and Singapore every
twenty-one days, calling at this port on her way to Brunei.

</p>
<p>The main industries of the colony are the coal-mines, sago-washing factories, and
the culture of rice, fruit, and other food products. The mines were leased by the
Government to the Oriental Coal Company of London and Leith, at a yearly rental of
£1000 a year for mining privileges and the right of cutting timber free of duty. £50
annually was also paid for a wharf and store sheds at the harbour, a distance of nine
miles from the mines. The coal was brought down in large sailing boats or lighters,
manned by Malays. In 1876 only 5824 tons were obtained, but additional workings have
been opened and alterations were made by the Company&#x2019;s manager, Mr. A. Boosie, which
it was thought would have facilitated a much larger output. The greatest drawbacks
to successful mining <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>operations were the enormous rainfall and its effects on the workings, and the inefficiency
of native labour. Chinese coolies have now, however, been to a great extent substituted
for the Malays previously employed. The ships of H.M. Navy have a prior claim to coal
at £1 0<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per ton, ordinary trading vessels pay a trifle more. The revenues of the Colony are
derived from various monopolies, such as the sale of opium, tobacco, spirits, fish,
arms, and ammunition, the rental or sale of lands, and a per centage on all timber
cut in the Colony.
</p>
<p>In 1876 the opium farmer paid £2,687 10<i>s.</i> for the exclusive right of importing, preparing, selling, or exporting opium in the
island. Tobacco produced £750; spirits, £300; fishmarket, £550; pawnbroking, £112
10<i>s.</i>; licences to sell arms and ammunition, £65. A duty of ten per cent. is payable on
the value of all timber cut on crown lands, except by the Coal Company, who, as already
stated, have the right, free. The estimated acreage of the colony is 19,350 acres,
of which 1,738 acres are supposed to be cultivatable, and 17,612 uncultivatable. Field
labour, the felling of timber, &amp;c., is carried on by Chinese and Malays, who receive
25 to 30 cents per day; carpenters, 50 cents; blacksmiths, 60 cents. The land under
padi (rice) cultivation is about 11,000 acres, and consists of well watered alluvial
plains near the centre of the island. Cocoanut palms and other fruit trees, 550 acres;
sugarcane and vegetable gardens, about 50 acres. The Chinese here, as elsewhere eastward,
monopolize the vegetable-growing industry. The largest cocoanut plantation and oil
factory is on Pulu Daát, a large islet lying between Labuan and the Bornean coast.
The total number of cocoanut trees in the colony is estimated at 200,000. The nuts,
retail, either green or ripe, fetch two or three cents each, and the oil obtained
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>from them fetches the uniform price of £33 per ton. A young plantation of the African
oil-palm (<i lang="la">Elæis guineensis</i>) has been established on Pulu Daát, and the experiment promises to be a successful
one. The little coarse uncrystallised sugar made in the colony fetches about 50 cents
per gantang, a measure holding about 7lb. Padi, or rice in husk, fetches about £1
10<i>s.</i> per 100 gantangs (6 cwts.). There are three sago washing works near Victoria Harbour,
where the raw pulp, as brought from the Bornean coast, is hand-washed and sifted into
the dry sago-flour of commerce. Some of the low-lying well watered or marsh-land has
been planted with the sago-palm.
</p>
<p>A new fishmarket has been erected, and this building, together with the right of buying
and selling all the fish caught, is let annually to the highest bidder with the other
farms. No regular fisheries are organised, nor is any record kept of the quantity
and description of fish supplied. It is estimated at about 1000 piculs. In the capture
of fish along the coast, seine nets and &#x201c;kelongs&#x201d; or bamboo traps are used. In deep
water a baited hook and line.
</p>
<p>An oil-spring exists in the forest, near the mines, at an elevation of 130 feet above
the sea, the yield during wet season being about 12 gallons of petroleum every twenty-four
hours. The highest land in the island is Bukit Kalám, 280 feet above sea level. The
total area in scrubs and fern is 1000 acres, timber or forest about 300 acres. The
quit-rents on lands sold for 999 years produce about £230 annually. It not being considered
advisable to alienate any further crown lands at present on account of the low prices
obtainable, the Government rice lands are let annually for prices varying from two
to four shillings per acre. The edible fruits cultivated are fine oranges of several
kinds, excellent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118">118</a>]</span>pomoloes, Durian, mangoes, tarippe, rambutan, <span class="corr" id="xd29e1657" title="Source: jack fruit">jack-fruit</span> and champada, rose apples (jambosa), cocoanuts, mangosteen, rambi, bananas in variety,
limes, guava, papaw, cashew nut, and several others, including the bread-fruit, baloonas,
mambangan. The total revenue in 1877 was £7,490, the expenditure being £7,995. Imports,
total value, £126,594, exports £112,996. Cattle and ponies are cheap&#x2014;thus, good cows
are worth £2 to £4 each; Shanghai sheep, £1 to £2; goats, 10<i>s.</i> each; ponies, £4 to £10. These last are imported from the Sulu Islands. Water buffaloes
are generally used as draught animals, and are worth from £4 to £6 each.
</p>
<p>The whole island is tolerably flat, and at one time was entirely covered with forests,
yielding fine timber. Of late years, however, jungle fires have been frequent during
the dry season; and at the present time but little old forest remains. The climate
is now generally supposed to be drier and more healthy than formerly; but the flora
has suffered much, many orchids and other rare plants, formerly found here in abundance,
being now quite extinct. After the rains a lovely little blue burmannia (<i lang="la">B. c&#x153;lestis</i>), and a tiny sundew become very pretty on the plains. Yellow flowered xyrids and
eriocaulons grace the wet ditches, and the orange orchards are redolent with perfume,
the trees being then in bloom, and at night the gardens are illuminated with fire-flies.
</p>
<div class="figure p119width" id="p119"><img src="images/p119.jpg" alt="ELK&#x2019;S-HORN FERN." width="427" height="573"><p class="figureHead">ELK&#x2019;S-HORN FERN.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>I resided for some time in a house which had been occupied by Mr. Hugh Low, the garden
and fruit orchard of which afforded the most delightful walks morning and evening.
I never saw the elk&#x2019;s-horn fern (<i lang="la">Platycerium grande</i>) so luxuriant anywhere as it was on the boles of some large orange-trees here. The
barren fronds were broad, like the horns of the giant Irish elk; and the more slender
fertile ones drooped on all sides from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119">119</a>]</span>base of the nest formed by the leafy expansions. I measured some of these fertile
fronds, and found them fully seven feet in length. These splendid ferns (one of which
is here represented in my sketch), and the choicest of epiphytal orchids, which had
been planted among the branches of the trees, made a walk amongst them most enjoyable.
I thought at the time I should never like to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120">120</a>]</span>see orchids, and other rare exotics stewed up in a glass shed again, after seeing
them thus luxuriant in the open air.
</p>
<p>The flowering trees, many of which have been introduced into the gardens, are very
lovely a week or two after the rains. <i lang="la">Poinciana regia</i>, two or three species of cassia, and <i lang="la">Lagerstr&#x153;mia regina</i>, and <i lang="la">L. indica</i>, with white lilac or rosy flowers, are common. Different kinds of jasmines, ixoras,
and hibiscus flower freely nearly all the year, as also does <i lang="la">Thunbergia laurifolia</i>, which drapes trees, and fences, the fire-blossomed pomegranate, the fragrant oleander;
there are also pools filled with the sunshade-like leaves and rosy flowers of the
Sacred Lotus, the beauty of which rivals even the celebrated Lotus pools of Japan.
One or two honey-suckles and <i lang="la">Jasminum grandiflorum</i> form tangled masses in the hedges, the pearly flowers of <i lang="la">Pancratium zeylanicum</i> spring up from the grass, sheltered here and there by caladium leaves, and a scarlet
hippeastrum forms glowing masses in old gardens, and on waste places where houses
have once been situated.
</p>
<p>Where many indigenous plants have died out, this hippeastrum has become naturalised:
the light sandy soil and hot sun seem to suit its requirements; and it increases so
freely, that a barrow-load of bulbs might be dug from a square yard of earth. Another
introduced plant, perfectly naturalised here, as also in Penang and Singapore, is
the dwarf and acrid <i lang="la">Isotoma longiflora</i>, which bears snowy-white long-tubed flowers. The purple-flowered &#x201c;Mudar&#x201d; (<i lang="la">Calotropis gigantea</i>), and the glorious mauve wreaths of <i lang="la">Bougainvillea spectabilis</i>, are in places very beautiful. The climate is hot, especially during the dry season;
but about five o&#x2019;clock <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, when the land breeze sets in, it is cool and agreeable.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121">121</a>]</span></p>
<p>Mangoes, especially the fine Manilla varieties, and pomoloes, grow well in the gardens
and orchards, as also do oranges of various kinds. The soil is so poor, however, that
in order to obtain fine fruit, it is necessary to keep a herd of cattle, and to fold
them at night, for the sake of a good supply of manure. Where the trees are planted
on the grass, a circle beneath each is cultivated with the &#x201c;chunkal,&#x201d; or heavy iron
hoe; and this is regularly manured and watered. It is quite usual to see the boles
of mango and some other fruit trees gashed with blows from a chopper at intervals,
an operation <span class="corr" id="xd29e1718" title="Source: analagous">analogous</span> to the ringing or strangulation formerly practised in English gardens before root-pruning
came into fashion. This is done to induce the trees to bear fruit earlier, and more
abundantly.
</p>
<p>There is only one species of bird endemic, a lively black and white one (<i lang="la">Copsychus am&#x153;nus</i>), which frequents gardens near the bungalows, and sings very sweetly during wet weather;
indeed, it was the only Eastern song bird which reminded me of our dappled thrush
at home. Of eagles and fish hawks there are several species. Tern are seen in flocks
on neighbouring sand-banks. Golden plover and snipe abound on the plain near the shore,
and there two or three sand pipers and rails. The white crane, or &#x201c;padi bird,&#x201d; is
common; and the long-pinioned frigate bird wheels overhead, far out of gun-shot, diving
now and then into the sea after food with wonderful velocity. The mellow whistle of
the mino bird is one of the most familiar sounds of the forest, especially when the
fruit of the wild figs ripen, and then white, large blue, and pretty little green
tree pigeons of many kinds appear, attended by flocks of glossy, red-eyed starlings.
</p>
<p>The &#x201c;chuck, chuck&#x201d; of the goat-sucker (<i lang="la">Caprimulgus <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122">122</a>]</span>macrurus</i>) is one of the most familiar sounds during moonlight nights. At daybreak the chatter
of the Java sparrows assures one of its being high time to rise. Cuming&#x2019;s mound bird
(<i lang="la">Megapodius Cumingi</i>) is found in Labuan, but is more common on the islets of Kuraman, where its nests
are met with in mounds of earth, three to four feet in height, and twelve feet in
circumference.
</p>
<p>Even the Nicobar pigeon visits this island; and a solitary hoopoo was shot there during
my visit. Two species of great beaked hornbills inhabit the forest; and there are
three or four species of swallows. One of the prettiest of all the small birds is
a long-tailed green and brown fly-catcher, which might easily be mistaken for a swallow,
so swift and graceful is its flight. A large red kingfisher (<i lang="la">Halcyon caromanda</i>), found here, builds its nest in a peculiar manner, as described by Mr. Sharpe, in
Proc. Zool. Soc., 1879, part ii., p. 331:&#x2014;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;The nest is said to be pendulous, and invariably to be accompanied in the same mass
by a bee, which is peculiarly vicious, so that the nest can only be robbed after destroying
the bees.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The interior of the island is flat and marshy; and here the soil being deep and alluvial,
it is well adapted for rice; and the wet patches beside the streams suit the sago
palm well. In the patches of low jungle beside the roads three or four species of
pitcher plants abound, rooting into the wet, sandy peat earth, and climbing up the
shrubby undergrowth in the most luxuriant and graceful manner. These nepenthes stems
are wonderfully tough, and are used as withes, and as a substitute for rattan cane
in tying fence timbers together. More rarely they are used in basket-work. The kinds
most common in Labuan are <i lang="la">N. gracilis</i>, several varieties, <i lang="la">N. nivea</i>, and <i lang="la">N. ampullaria</i>. There are five or six species <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123">123</a>]</span>of terrestrial orchids; and from trees on Dr. Ley&#x2019;s estate plants of the new genus
astrostruma (<i lang="la">A. spartiodes</i>, Benth.) were gathered for the first time.
</p>
<p>Alligators infest the streams, and shallow sea, near the town of Victoria; and now
and then a native is carried off. One of these large brutes actually tried to carry
off a pony one night during my stay. Snakes are plentiful. A deadly green snake is
common on the Bird Island, just off the mouth of the harbour, and great brown rock
snakes abound. One night a Kling man brought a black snake, six feet long, tied to
a stick, which he said he had caught up a cocoa-nut tree, and added that it had just
swallowed a bird. It was purchased; and in the morning, when it was being skinned,
the &#x201c;boy&#x201d; came to say that it had young ones inside it. This we did not believe; and,
on going to see it, we found that the &#x201c;young one&#x201d; was a snake, two feet long, of another
species, very common in the island, which had been swallowed head foremost, as usual,
and was in part digested. The large snake was so fat, that hunger could not have prompted
it to swallow a smaller brother; and so I more than suspect that Malaysia can now
boast of a snake-eating snake, as well as British India, whence one of these cannibals,
the <i lang="la">ophiophagus</i>, was introduced to the Zoological Gardens a few years ago.
</p>
<p>A large boa, ten to twenty feet long, and as thick as one&#x2019;s arm, is common in the
jungle, and often commits depredations amongst badly-housed poultry, as also does
the iguana. A singular sluggishness characterised all the snakes I saw; and as many
of those said to be deadly by the natives rest on the trees, rather than on the ground,
this may account for the extreme rarity of death from snake-bites in this part of
the East. A <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124">124</a>]</span>slender green species, nearly six feet in length, infests the fig-trees when in fruit;
and, twisting its tail around a branch, it coils itself up ready to spring at any
bird unwary enough to venture sufficiently close. One of these I saw shot; and it
had a double row of hooked fangs in its wide set jaws, admirably adapted to hold anything
once within its grasp.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most lovely and interesting of all, however, are the sun-birds, which
are here in the East the representatives of the true humming-birds of the Western
tropics. &#x201c;They are ethereal, gay, and sprightly in their movements, flitting briskly
from flower to flower, and assuming a thousand lovely and agreeable attitudes. As
the sunbeams glitter on their bodies, they sparkle like so many precious stones, and
exhibit at every turn a variety of bright and evanescent hues. As they hover around
the honey-laden blossoms, they vibrate their tiny pinions so rapidly, as to cause
a slight whirring sound, but not so loud as the humming noise produced by the true
humming birds. Occasionally they may be seen clinging by their feet and tail busily
engaged in rifling the blossoms of the trees. I well remember a certain dark-leaved
tree with scarlet flowers, that especially courted the attention of the sun-birds;
and about its blossoms they continually darted with eager and vivacious movements.
With this tree they seemed particularly delighted, clinging to the slender twigs,
and coquetting with the flowers, thrusting in their slender curved beaks, and probing
with their brush-like tongues for insects and nectar, hanging suspended by their feet,
throwing back their little glossy heads, chasing each other on giddy wing, and flirting
and twittering, the gayest of the gay. Some were emerald-green, some vivid violet,
and others yellow, with a crimson wing.&#x201d;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125">125</a>]</span></p>
<p>Sir Jas. Emerson Tennent describes them as being common in Ceylon, where they frequent
the gardens, and rifle the blossoms of the passifloras, and other flowers; at other
times searching for small insects and spiders, and again pluming themselves, and warbling
their pleasing songs on the pomegranate-trees. &#x201c;If two happened to come to the same
flower&#x2014;and from their numbers this has often occurred&#x2014;a battle always ensued, which
ended in the vanquished bird retreating from the spot with shrill piping cries, while
the conqueror would take up his position upon a flower or stem, and swinging his little
body to and fro, till his coat of burnished steel gleamed and glistened in the sun,
pour out his song of triumph.&#x201d; The rich plumage of the dainty little male birds is
only seen during the breeding season, after which they moult, and are as unattractive
as their mates. Two tiny eggs are laid in a wee nest, which is suspended from a twig,
or sometimes the stout web of a large spider is made to bear the little shelter for
eggs and young.
</p>
<p>The spiders in the jungle, and old buildings of the East, are numerous; and some are
of an alarming size, but of beautiful colours. One large, black, yellow-spotted species
measures six or eight inches across its extended legs, and its web is held in position
by grey lines, almost as stout as fine sewing-cotton, and strong enough to pull one&#x2019;s
hat off. It is a very disagreeable sensation to feel them across one&#x2019;s face, as often
happens in a little used jungle-path. Ants are particularly plentiful; and the white
termites throw up mounds of red earth, five or six feet in height, and often do much
damage by burrowing into the piles of houses, and other buildings. The species of
ants vary much in size. One is a tiny red fellow, but little larger than a cheese-mite,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126">126</a>]</span>and scarcely visible; others are black, their bodies being an inch in length. Some
species bite very sharp if disturbed, as I found to my cost, when scrambling about
over the branches of trees after orchids, and other plants. There is one species of
nepenthes (<i lang="la">N. bicalcarata</i>), having large red urns, the stalks of which are invariably perforated by a species
of ant; and I found a flowering shrub on the Tawaran river, the stems of which were
swollen and hollow just below the flower-heads, this being due to the punctures of
ants; a remarkably curious gouty-stemmed plant, parasitical on low jungle-trees in
Labuan&#x2014;myrmecodia&#x2014;actually depends for its existence on the bite of a species of ant.
The seed germinates on the bark of the foster-tree; and when the seedling has attained
a certain height, the growth ceases, and it remains stationary, until the necessary
bite is given, when the stem swells out at the base, and leaves and flowers are produced
in due course. If not thus punctured, the young plant dies. The gouty or swollen stem
is hollow, and forms a refuge for the ants, which in their turn may afford it some
needful protection, since they rush out boldly to attack trespassers who disturb the
tree on which their fostered-shelter plant grows.
</p>
<p>One day, as I emerged from the forest on the western shore of the island, I came across
a young Kadyan engaged in making salt. The process, as carried out by him, was very
simple. A heap of drift wood is collected, and of this a fire is made, so as to secure
a good supply of ashes. The ashes are placed in a small tub, and sea-water is filtered
through them, so as to catch up whatever salt they contain. It now remains for the
water to be evaporated, so as to leave the salt. To this end evaporating-pans, or
rather receptacles, are neatly made from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127">127</a>]</span>the sheaths of the nebong palm, fastened into shape by slender wooden skewers. Two
logs are then laid parallel to each other, and a foot or fifteen inches apart, and
over these the pans are placed close together, so as to form a rude kind of flue,
in the which a fire of light brushwood is lighted, and very soon afterwards the salt
may be observed falling to the bottom of the evaporators. It was a very hot morning,
and the heat in the close forest where I had been exploring was so intense, that I
was thankful to reach the coast and feel the delicious breezes which came from the
open sea. The beach to the westward of the island is mainly of firm yellow sand, but
here and there paved more or less thickly with honey-combed coral rocks and pebbles.
The outer edge of the old forest nearest the shore is fringed with tall casuarina
trees, here called &#x201c;Kayu Aru.&#x201d; The Malays have some legends connected with this tree,
and can rarely be induced to cut it down, although the tough light timber is well
suited for some particular purposes.
</p>
<p>Under a group of these trees a large company of Kadyans were encamped, and busily
engaged making &#x201c;Pratchan.&#x201d; This is a reddish product made of prawns. Some of the men
were out in canoes just beyond the shallow reefs catching the tiny fish, while others
and the women and girls were preparing them on shore. The fish are jammed up in troughs
formed of hollow trunks of trees by beating wooden pestles, and when finished resembles
a stiff red paste, which is afterwards packed in circular palm-leaf bags or baskets
for the Chinese markets. Some of the fish were being dried by being spread out in
the sun on mats. They were bright as burnished silver, and in flavour reminded one
of whitebait. The price of the red paste, or prepared &#x201c;Pratchan,&#x201d; is about three <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128">128</a>]</span>dollars per picul, and the dried article fetches ten or twelve cents per gantang.
Their encampment of yellow palm-leaf mats and bamboo poles formed a pretty rural scene
beneath the tall trees which overhung the yellow sands, and the dusky limbs and faces,
and the bright-coloured &#x201c;sarongs&#x201d; worn by the women of the party, added much to the
picturesque view as seen beneath a blue and cloudless sky. I and Mr. A. Cook visited
the oil springs, which are situated in a shady glade in the forest two or three miles
from the coal-mines. All the evidence of the old borings we saw was an old door and
a rude trough, into which the oil-surfaced water rises as it wells up slowly from
the rocks below. No use is now made of this oil, except by the Kadyans and other natives,
who utilise it now and then in the manufacture of torches. The odour of the oil is
distinctly perceptible near the spring, and the oil itself covers the surface of the
little stream as it flows seawards. Before the spring was reached we passed through
an open clearing of a hundred of acres or more covered with grass, on which a few
milch cattle belonging to some of the Kling residents were grazing. We were surprised
in one place to come across an old garden, of several acres in extent, containing
mango, banana, and other fruit trees, with here and there native huts, houses, and
rice-barns all going to decay. A Kadyan, who overtook us just before we entered the
forest, told us it was an old village belonging to his tribe, adding that they had
abandoned it after their headman had died there. It is by no means unusual to find
localities abandoned in this way in Borneo owing to the death of the principal man
in the village, and when the rotten old palm-thatched houses have been eaten up by
the luxuriant jungle which springs up around, the fruit-trees prosper and serve to
mark the localities of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129">129</a>]</span>former villages long after they themselves have vanished for ever.

</p>
<p>Here, as elsewhere in warm climates, the mosquito is of all animals the smallest and
most troublesome to the weary traveller. Large moths flutter about the ceilings, especially
on cold wet nights, and insect life of many kinds is attracted to the lamplight. In
every house there is a colony of lively little drab-coloured lizards. They run very
nimbly up the sides of the room and on the ceiling, keeping a sharp look-out the while
for their supper of moths and flies. The Malays have a proverb, &#x201c;That even a lizard
gives the fly time to pray.&#x201d; This has been derived from the peculiar manner in which
this tiny Saurian &#x201c;goes for&#x201d; its quarry. On seeing a fly it darts at it swiftly, but
when within an inch or two <span class="corr" id="xd29e1794" title="Source: off">of</span> it suddenly stops itself and pauses several seconds ere the fatal spring is made
and the fly seized. Now and then the lizards lose their hold of the ceiling and come
on the table with a &#x201c;flop,&#x201d; but this is a rare occurrence. One of the most common
and interesting of the domestic insects is the &#x201c;mason wasp,&#x201d; a large yellow species
which constructs a series of mud cells or a gallery of earth against the woodwork
of the verandah or roof. In each cell, as completed, an egg is deposited, and ere
closing up the cavity it is stuffed full of green caterpillars, which are then sealed
up alive to serve as food for her larva when hatched out. The big black carpenter
bees are also often seen examining the woodwork of the house or verandah, and on finding
a piece in suitable condition they bore a clean hole into it in which to deposit their
eggs. These two insects are highly interesting&#x2014;a mason and a carpenter&#x2014;and both do
&#x201c;worke moste excellently well.&#x201d; Native houses and gardens are dotted pretty freely
about the island, and there are some interesting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130">130</a>]</span>walks. I was enabled to explore the island pretty well, in which work the Hon. Dr.
Leys very kindly assisted me by the loan of his favourite horse &#x201c;Joseph.&#x201d; This animal
was the most gentle and tractable creature imaginable, and admirably accustomed to
jungle travelling, since he would go anywhere among trees or bushes, and might be
trusted to stand quietly if tied; or he would follow one like a dog if loose. He was
of Australian breed, and had his faults too. At the &#x201c;whisk&#x201d; of a whip or stick he
was inclined to bolt, and once threw me pretty heavily when frightened in that way.
Another trick he had was to stop suddenly at any place where he had turned off the
road, or had been tied before, and as he would stop short or turn off thus suddenly
when at full gallop, the consequences which sometimes resulted from such freaks may
be readily imagined. With all his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131">131</a>]</span>vagaries, however, he was a sleek and loveable creature; and I once saw the little
daughter of the Doctor&#x2019;s Malay syce or groom lift up one of his hind legs when in
the stable, at the same time telling her little group of dusky playfellows how very
vicious he was (eine kudah jahat&#x2014;jahat banyiak skali, etu lah!). &#x201c;Joseph&#x201d; was the
swiftest animal in the island, and rigorously excluded from competing at the races
held on the plain by the shore every New Year&#x2019;s Day. These annual races and sports
are much appreciated both by Europeans and natives, and they afford the only general
holiday in which both natives and Europeans mingle during the year.

<p>The native canoe races in the harbour are a speciality, the Malays and Brunei men
being here seen in their native element. The &#x201c;tug of war&#x201d; between Malays and Chinese
is also an amusing feature, while all are interested in the performance of the ponies
and in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>European athletic sports. A palm-thatched erection beneath the casuarina trees, near
Ramsay Point, does duty as a grand stand and refreshment bar, and from the slight
elevation, it affords an excellent view of the dusky but smiling faces and parti-coloured
costumes of the natives and Chinese. All the native beauties are present, and glimpses
of bright expressive eyes, coal-black hair secured with silver pins, and brilliant
sarongs beneath neat cool-looking sacques meet one at every turn. Here and there the
sparkle of jewellery and the glitter of bangles meet the eye, and on all sides the
lavish display of pearly teeth and the ripple of merry laughter is seen and heard.
A dinner at Government House, to which almost all the Europeans in the island, or
from the gunboat which may happen to be in harbour, are invited, winds up this gala
day of the opening year.
</p>
<p>There is a neat little wooden church here on the hill behind Government House, and
there is a service once or twice every third year, when the Lord Bishop of Sarawak
visits this part of his diocese. From some of the elevated portions of the island
beautiful views are obtainable, with the blue mountains of Borneo towering skywards
in the distance; and from the verandah of the manager&#x2019;s house at the coal-mines at
the northern end of the island, Kina Balu may be seen quite plainly at sunrise and
sunset during clear weather; and although more than a hundred miles away, its topmost
crags stand out clear and sharp, and are tinged with the most beautiful tints of purple
and gold by the rising or the setting sun.
</p>
<p>It was from Labuan that my visits to the Bornean coast and to Sulu were made. Some
of these adventurous wanderings were pleasant, others the reverse. The following is
a short account of a boat journey made by myself and Mr. Peter Veitch, its object
being to obtain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133">133</a>]</span>pitcher plants (<i lang="la">Nepenthes bicalcarata</i>), <i lang="la">Burbidgea nitida</i>, <i lang="la">Pinanga Veitchii</i>, <i lang="la">Cypripedium Lawrenceanum</i>, and other beautiful fine-foliaged plants and orchids:&#x2014;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Towards the noon of a hot day in January 1878&#x2014;a day hot even for the tropics&#x2014;two
Veitchian travellers in North-western Borneo, with their native contingent of guides,
boatmen, and carriers, were descending one of the most lovely of all the rivers in
the island. The water was clear and smooth&#x2014;so clear and so smooth that the great nipa
leaves, which arched gracefully out from the banks and laved their ends in the stream,
were reflected in the water as clearly as if in a mirror. The boatmen were in good
spirits, for there was but little work for their paddles, so they chewed their betel-nut
and limed pepper leaves contentedly, or rolled up a little tobacco, cigarette-like,
in wrappers made of the young leaves of <i lang="la">Nipa fruticans</i>, and smoked in a silence only broken by low laughter and sentences murmured in the
most musical of tongues. The river banks were clothed with forest trees, as also was
the rising ground behind, and where the river was shallow mangrove trees, thickly
interlaced, took the place of the big fruited nipa. On the lower trees near the fringe
of the forest c&#x153;logynes, dendrobes, bolbophyllums, and other orchids&#x2014;not often beautiful
as that word is too often understood&#x2014;clothed the branches; the tiny <i lang="la">Davallia parvula</i>, <i lang="la">D. heterophylla</i>, and <i lang="la">D. pedata</i>&#x2014;all modest little species of ferns&#x2014;were also seen on tree trunks or on rocks, and
on the outer branches far overhead <i lang="la">Platycerium biforme</i> made itself a home, its fertile fronds drooping four or five feet below the cluster
of barren ones. For company, but never at so great a height, varieties of <i lang="la">Neottopteris nidus avis</i>, or an allied species, were seen forming nests of glossy broadly strap-shaped fronds
often of great length. Of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>palms the &#x2018;Nebong&#x2019; (<i lang="la">Oncosperma filamentosum</i>) and the unique red-stemmed &#x2018;Malawarin&#x2019; (which long defied Eastern collectors who
wished to introduce it to Europe) were most beautiful. The former produces an excellent
&#x2018;cabbage,&#x2019; as good as seakale when well cooked, and its old stems are generally employed
as piles by the Malays, who almost always erect <span class="corr" id="xd29e1851" title="Source: ther">their</span> palm-thatched &#x2018;atap&#x2019; houses over the water of river or sea.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Bird-life generally was dozing&#x2014;the birds were enjoying their noontide siesta in the
shady trees. The handsome Bornean pheasants, the &#x2018;Argus,&#x2019; the &#x2018;Fireback,&#x2019; and the
&#x2018;Bulwer&#x2019; with its pure snowy tail of blackcock-like shape, were alike unseen and unheard.
Now and then the deep rich and mellow whistle of the &#x2018;Mino&#x2019; bird or Javanese &#x2018;Grackle&#x2019;
reached us, and a whole colony of large blue, and of pretty little greyish green,
yellow-winged pigeons&#x2014;Carpophagi&#x2014;were surprised on a fig tree in fruit as the canoe
shot around a sudden bend in the stream. Of the seven or eight species of hornbills
known to inhabit these groves we saw not one&#x2014;indeed our view of the birds would have
been but meagre but for the apparition of a black darter with only its head or neck
above the water, in which attitude its resemblance to a snake is well nigh perfect.
A few kingfishers braved the sun and flitted alongside the nipa leaves, or flew rapidly
across stream like clusters of jewels endowed with life and motion. Scarcely a sound
disturbed the quietude and beauty of such a tropical scene, except that now and then
for no very apparent reason the boatmen made a spurt with their paddles, any little
extra exertion in this way being often accompanied by a plaintive song in chorus&#x2014;melody
in perfect keeping with a wildly natural albeit lovely spot. At one well-remembered
bend of the glassy stream the men had been directed to stop awhile, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135">135</a>]</span>and a few dexterous strokes of the paddle on the part of a handsome young Kadyan man
named &#x2018;Moumein,&#x2019; who acted as steersman, sent the canoe beneath the arching nipa plumes
to a bare spot where it was possible to land. The wet branches of a low mossy tree
were covered with the elegant little <i lang="la">Davallia parvula</i>, among which grew a cirrhopetalum only about two inches in height, and bearing little
purple flowers in semi-circular whorl-like tufts at the apices of tiny scapes. On
sandstone rocks near at hand the handsome <i lang="la">Dipteris Horsfieldii</i> was abundant, its stout rhizomes creeping over the nearly bare wet rock, and adhering
so firmly by its tiny rootlets that it was difficult to displace.<a class="noteref" id="xd29e1864src" href="#xd29e1864">1</a> Above one&#x2019;s head grew the great glossy green umbrella-like fronds, borne aloft on
stipes varying from two to eight feet in length. Truly a noble fern&#x2014;alas! how difficult
to cultivate. At the time I lived in the locality in which it is found in the utmost
luxuriance, I read of the plant being exhibited in London and elsewhere, but each
successive report of it unfortunately recorded its decadence. This and the glorious
<i lang="la">Matonia pectinata</i>&#x2014;also Bornean, although first found together with our old friends <i lang="la">Cypripedium barbatum</i>, <i lang="la">Nepenthes sanguinea</i>, and <i lang="la">Rhododendron jasminiflorum</i>, on Mount Ophir, in Malacca&#x2014;are two of the most noble of all ferns, rivalling the
palms indeed in stately beauty and substance of frond-tissue. How unfortunate, then,
is it that both so persistently resist the efforts alike of collectors and cultivators.
As one of the two travellers before-mentioned I had previously visited the spot where
we had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>now landed, and after a long walk through the tall forests, which are carpeted in
moist places and near streams by lovely steel-blue aspleniums and lindsayas, and also
by the freshest and most luxuriant of selaginellas, had, after ascending a sloping
and rather dry <span class="corr" id="xd29e1885" title="Source: hillside">hill-side</span>, come upon a plant which I saw at a glance was zingiberaceous, but it was so distinct
in port and flower to anything that I had previously seen that I sent roots of it
to Chelsea, and a few of these fortunately survived. Its fate was not known to us
at the time we again visited the spot, and so the object in again running the canoe
among the nipa plumes at this place was to obtain a fresh supply. I shall long remember
this second journey to collect <i lang="la">Burbidgea nitida</i>, since I was ill with fever at the time, and on Mr. Peter Veitch devolved the duty
of a long tramp through the tall forest; past numerous felled gutta-yielding trees
(<i lang="la">Isonandra sp.?</i>), and up the hill slope beyond, until just below the rocky summit, this plant is
found at a place called the &#x2018;Devil&#x2019;s House&#x2019; (&#x2018;<i lang="ms">Satan punya ruma</i>&#x2019;) where are some dark deep holes in the face of perpendicular rocks, frequented by
the swallows which build the edible nests so highly valued by the rich Chinese. The
burbidgea grows on low wet sandstone boulders, on which their rhizomes and roots form
a perfect mat, and among the plants as thus elevated decayed leaves and other forest
<i lang="fr">débris</i> is blown by winds or washed by rains. Although growing in rich shady forest, and
subjected to a heavy rainfall, and high, albeit fresh and often windy atmosphere,
the plants rarely exceed a yard in height. To this place Mr. Veitch went with a body
of trusty natives, and many bundles of the plants were brought back, some of them
fine masses of twenty or thirty stems, each having recently borne a large cluster
of its rich, orange-coloured flowers.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137">137</a>]</span></p>
<p>&#x201c;While Mr. Veitch was away, my Chinese boy, &#x2018;Kimjeck,&#x2019; got out the cooking utensils
to prepare dinner on the shore, and the men who stayed behind amused themselves by
looking for flowers (&#x2018;cheri bunga&#x2019;) in the low forest and on the sandstone rock near
our landing-place. I had to lie in the boat beneath the awning, feeling very sick,
and with a splitting headache&#x2014;feverish symptoms which all travellers in tropical forests
alike must suffer. I was just dozing off to sleep when I heard much yelling, and my
boy, who had joined the men, returned down the jungle path at full speed, shouting
&#x2018;Ular! Ular! Tuan! Sayah mow etu snapang lakas skali!&#x2019; &#x2018;Trima kasi!&#x2019; he ejaculated,
as he snatched my gun and disappeared with the agility of a young goat. The gist of
the matter was, he had seen a snake and was off to shoot it. After listening for ten
minutes to the most deafening shouts and yells, mingled with many ejaculations of
advice and caution, and the reports of both barrels echoing through the forest, I
was rather disappointed to see them return with a small snake, not larger than the
English viper. On my expressing my surprise, and observing that, by the noise, I thought
it was a snake big enough to swallow a buffalo, the men all agreed that what it lacked
in size was amply compensated for by its fatal bite&#x2014;or, as they expressed it, &#x2018;if
that snake bit a man he need not trouble about food any more, as he would have no
time to pray.&#x2019;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;The Muruts have a great love for gong music; and now and then a cheap German gun,
or old Tower musket, is obtained from Chinese traders. Spears, blow-pipes, krisses
or parongs (swords), and their ghastly baskets of human skulls, form their only accumulated
wealth. These heads are used to ornament their dwellings at their periodical seasons
of feasting, and when illuminated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138">138</a>]</span>by the flickering glare of &#x2018;dammar&#x2019; gum torches the effect is melodramatic in the
extreme. It was rather difficult to make any use of these Muruts as collectors&#x2014;they
showed no powers of discrimination whatever, while the Kadyans, on the other hand&#x2014;who
are also aboriginals, but have mixed much with the dominant Malays, by whom they were
years ago converted to the faith of Islam&#x2014;showed great aptitude, and were of real
service; and I shall long retain pleasant memories of some of the Kadyan villagers,
especially &#x2018;Moumein,&#x2019; of Meringit, who received me into the little village he had
founded with every demonstration of friendship, and rendered me much intelligent assistance
for many weeks. Of Malays generally one may say that they live by lying and thieving
in one form or another, but the aboriginal races of Borneo, like the Papuans whom
Goldie met inland in New Guinea, are gentle and hospitable to peaceably disposed strangers,
and it will be a great pity to see them exterminated in the way their prototypes,
the Incas of Peru, and the Red Men of the West, have been.&#x201d;

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Borneo, the beautiful&#x2014;the &#x201c;garden of the sun&#x201d;&#x2014;is the third largest island in the world,
and boasts a much larger area than that occupied by the British Isles. The equator
divides it, and the climate is, perhaps, that most suitable for vegetation of any
other, being uniformly hot and humid all the year round. There are no volcanoes, the
tiger is unknown, and it is the only habitat of the wild elephant in the Malay Archipelago.
It is also remarkable as being the home of the wild man of the forests, or the &#x201c;orang
utan&#x201d; of the Malays. Alligators abound in the rivers, and are the most dangerous of
the wild animals. Snakes exist plentifully, and in great variety, but death from snake-bites
is very rare. The two-horned rhinoceros, wild cattle, pigs in abundance, and several
species of deer are known.
</p>
<p>The human inhabitants may be roughly divided into two races, the Malays and the Borneans,
or aboriginals. The origin of both types is obscure. The Malays, however, are immigrants
who inhabit the coasts of all the large Malay islands where, as here in Borneo, they
have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140">140</a>]</span>long held the dominant power. Some believe them to have originally been the descendants
of Arabs who settled in the Celebes long before the Dutch became rulers in these seas,
and this view gains some support from the fact of the Arabic character being used
in writing, and their titles as Sultan, hadji, and sherrif, are of Arabic origin.
They all profess Islam. The Bornean Malays may be said to have but little literature:
the Koran, a few MS. poems, prayers, and tales are the only books generally seen in
the island; but the people possess a vast amount of traditional lore, and many of
their songs refer to the history of the country, the beauty of their women, or to
the personal attributes and prowess of their former rulers.
</p>
<p>The following may be taken as a fair sample of Malayan poetry, and was originally
published in the <i>Asiatic Journal</i>. Many of the tales and legends of the Malays are in blank verse, with a good many
repetitions; and choruses<a id="xd29e1924"></a> are extremely popular, as also are extemporaneous vocal performances:&#x2014;

<p>&#x201c;Having spoken thus, <i>Indra Mahadewa</i> bent his course wherever his uncertain steps might lead. With an anxious heart and
suffering from hunger and thirst, he penetrated into forests of great extent, ascended
high mountains, and crossed wide plains. The sun was now set, and the moon rose in
all her splendour as if to serve him for a torch. The prince, although fatigued, proceeded
towards the hills of <i>Indra Kila</i>, and as he passed, the tender branches of the climbing plants waved with the wind
and seemed inclined to follow the beautiful youth. As the dawn gradually arose, the
clouds in the border of the sky assumed a variety of shapes, some having the form
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143">143</a>]</span>trees, and some resembling animals; but the trees of the forest were still obscured
from sight by the dense vapour rising from the dew. The light of the sun now began
to appear, glancing from the interstices of the mountains like the countenance of
a lovely virgin, whilst its beams shooting upwards exhibited the appearance of flags
and banners waving in front of an army marching to battle.&#x201d;

<p>&#x201c;The king was highly pleased with the manners and disposition of <i>Dewa Indra</i>, as well as with his graceful person and superior understanding. He said to him,
&#x2018;Partake of betel, my son.&#x2019; <i>Dewa Indra</i> having accordingly partaken, returned the betel-stand to the king, who thus addressed
him: &#x2018;I have sent for you, my son, in order to make known to you a resolution taken
by me some time since; that to the person who having counted out ten large measures
of sesame seed and as many measures of sand, thoroughly blended together, should be
able to separate the grains of the one from the grains of the other, and to complete
the performance of the task in the course of a day; to such person alone should I
give the hand of my daughter in marriage.&#x2019; <i>Dewa Indra</i> smiled on hearing the king&#x2019;s words, knowing them to proceed from the artful suggestion
of the princes (his rivals), and bowing replied, &#x2018;whatever may be your majesty&#x2019;s injunctions,
your servant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>is ready to execute them.&#x2019; The sand and the sesame seed being then provided and mixed
together in the court before the palace, <i>Dewa Indra</i> made his obeisance, descended to the spot, and as he stood beside the heap, silently
wished for aid from the king of the ants; when instantly the monarch made his appearance,
followed by his whole army, consisting of the population of nine hillocks. Upon receiving
the directions of <i>Dewa Indra</i> for separating the grains, each individual ant took one seed in his mouth, and in
this manner the separation was presently effected and the grains laid in distinct
heaps, not one being wanting. This done, the king of the ants and all his train disappeared,
and returned to the place from whence they came. <i>Dewa Indra</i> reascended the steps of the palace, and having taken his seat and made obeisance,
said, &#x2018;Your Majesty&#x2019;s commands for the separation of the sand and the sesame seed
have been obeyed by your mean and humble slave.&#x2019; The king expressed his amazement,
and all the ministers of state, the warriors, and the people in general were astonished
at witnessing this proof of the supernatural power of <i>Dewa Indra</i>; but with respect to the princes, some of them shook their heads, some bent them
down, and others turned them aside, being unable to support his looks.&#x201d;

<p>The Malays of Borneo acknowledge the rule of a Sultan, who is assisted by various
Ministers of State, who are principally his own relations. The Court at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145">145</a>]</span>Brunei is kept up by taxes imposed on the few Chinese merchants, and on the native
Borneans who live inland beside the rivers on the north-west coast from the Baram
to Kimanis. A yearly payment is also made to the Sultan by the Rajah of Sarawak. Many
of the Malays are traders. The poorer classes are sailors, fishermen, or engaged in
simple domestic industries.
</p>
<p>The true bred Malay has a penchant for building his pile dwelling over the shallow
water near the mouth of or beside a river wherever such a site is procurable. The
Borneans, on the other hand, prefer a clearing near the streams, and some tribes,
especially the Dusan, build their huts high up in the hills.
</p>
<p>Intermarriages with native women have helped to identify the Malays with the Borneans,
and especially with the Kadyans, a tribe who live near the capital, and who long ago
embraced the faith of Mahomet. The language of the Malays is soft and pleasing in
sound&#x2014;the &#x201c;Italian of the East&#x201d;&#x2014;and very expressive. It is readily acquired by strangers,
and forms the medium of commercial communication throughout the Straits Settlements
and Malay Archipelago. Like our own tongue, Malay seems to be a conventional blending
of several other languages, Arabic, Sanscrit, and the languages of the aboriginals
with whom the Malays were first thrown into contact. At the present day many English
and Portuguese words find their way into it but little disguised by pronunciation.
Malay is the Court language at Brunei, but the inhabitants generally use a dialect
similar to that of the aboriginals who live near the capital.
</p>
<p>The clothing of the Malays of high rank is often very lavish and showy, consisting
of fancy head-cloths and short jackets, often highly embroidered with gold buttons
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146">146</a>]</span>and wire or lace. White trowsers, similar to those worn by Europeans, and patent leather
slippers are also affected by the rich Malays, and all, rich or poor, wear the national
&#x201c;sarong,&#x201d; a sort of chequered petticoat wound around the waist, and allowed to fall
to the feet in graceful folds. When trowsers are worn a shorter &#x201c;sarong&#x201d; is worn kilt-fashion,
barely reaching as low as the knees. The Malay Hadjis or priests wear long green Arab
coats, and green or white turbans around their shaven heads. The women when engaged
in their household duties wear nothing but a &#x201c;sarong&#x201d; reaching from the breasts to
the feet. When abroad, however, neat print sacques reaching as low as the knees are
worn, having long and tight sleeves. This dress opens in front, and is fastened by
a set of three silver or gold brooches. Below this a chequered, or Javanese sarong
reaches from the waist to the ankles. Beautiful sarongs are made by the Brunei ladies.
They are richly embroidered with gold wire, and are worn by the well-to-do women along
the coast.
</p>
<p>Slippers of European or Chinese manufacture are sometimes worn. Their black hair is
oiled profusely, and secured behind with silver pins. It is often perfumed by tying
up in it flowers of the champaca, jasmine, gardenia, or other scented blossoms over
night. Both men and women bathe at least twice daily, morning and evening, and the
women dye their nails with a mixture made of the red stems of a common balsam, mixed
with lime juice, as a substitute for the henna so largely used in Persia and Egypt.

<p>There are some very singular liberties allowed to loving swains in out of the way
places in Wales and Cornwall, but those allowed by the Malay and native girls of Borneo
to their favourite lovers are of a yet more faithful kind. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147">147</a>]</span>A Bornean youth may enter the house of his loved one&#x2019;s parents and awaken her if she
be really sleeping, to sit and talk with him in the dark, or to eat betel-nut and
the finest of sirih-leaves from his garden. A similar custom, so far as nocturnal
visits are concerned, formerly existed in the country districts of Scotland. It is
but seldom that immorality results from this custom in Borneo, even according to European
ideas on the subject, and the parents think no more of putting a stop to these nightly
meetings than do those of our own fair daughters in the case of the &#x201c;morning call&#x201d;
of an eligible suitor at home. There was a grand wedding at the capital during one
of my visits there, the bride being a relation of his Highness the Sultan. There was
a grand procession of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148">148</a>]</span>boats on the river, and a large lighter had been decorated with parti-coloured flags
and streamers, and in the centre a raised daïs and a canopy overhead of red cloth
had been erected for the parties mainly concerned. In the case of the Malays there
is the usual religious ceremony, at which the &#x201c;hadjis&#x201d; appear and chant the prayers
in gorgeous apparel of green Arabic coat and ample turban. There was much firing of
cannon throughout the town, the whole event lasting nearly a week, and there was a
grand reception, the bride and bridegroom being seated in state on a raised daïs,
and covered with finery and gold ornaments, mostly borrowed for the occasion. In the
interior, where nearly all enjoy &#x201c;liberty, equality, and fraternity,&#x201d; in a way one
can only dream of in civilised &#x201c;society,&#x201d; marriage is very simple, and monogamy the
rule. The celebration of a marriage consists of a notification of the fact, and it
is acknowledged by all in the village, who meet for feasting. A couple of fowls or
a goat is killed, and the appearances presented by these after death furnish auguries
of good or ill fortune for the newly married pair.

<p>The native Borneans proper are sparsely scattered over the whole country, and are
divided into various tribes, each inhabiting a particular district, and speaking a
dialect peculiar to itself. These tribes have been compared with the natives of our
English counties, but they are much more distinct, each having its own customs, dress,
mode of life, weapons, and in many cases a language unknown to the tribes only a few
miles distant. The Dyaks, Kayans, Muruts, Kadyans, Dusun, and Lanun, are a few only
of these tribes. Another peculiar race are the Badjows, or &#x201c;Sea Gipsies,&#x201d; common to
all the islands of these seas. They are nomadic&#x2014;water rovers&#x2014;and engaged in diving
for pearls, or pearl shell, fishing, or in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149">149</a>]</span>petty trade. They rarely settle down on shore, or remain long in one place, but live
in their boats. Indeed they are the gipsies of the sea in every sense of the word,
and given to pilfering like their namesakes on shore. The Badjows, Lanun, Balagnini,
and Sulus, who inhabit the north of Borneo and the islands to the north-east are an
adventurous people given to piracy, and, of course, excellent sailors. The Muruts
are the only existing race of head-hunters north of the capital. The Dusun and Kadyans,
although formerly head-hunters, have now taken to agricultural pursuits, and are well
fed and prosperous compared to the Muruts, who, although they clear and plant the
land around their immensely long pile dwellings, still depend much on their skill
in hunting wild pig, deer, and other game for food. The Dyaks of Sarawak, although
formerly fierce and warlike, are now peaceful and industriously engaged in seafaring
or agricultural pursuits. The Kayans are still warlike, and a fine race of straight-limbed
powerful people. They formerly inhabited the country inland near the Limbang and used
to plunder the villages of the Muruts and Sabayans, killing the men, and taking the
women and children into slavery. Of late years, however, they have migrated further
south, and their head-quarters are now on the Baram river. The Lanuns live on the
coasts north of Menkabong, and are petty traders or cultivators. Like the Badjows,
however, they have a lingering affection for the sea. The Dusun, who live in the hills
further from the coast, give them a bad character and assert that formerly they used
to steal their children.
</p>
<p>Land culture is becoming much more general among the natives inland than formerly,
security of life and property having also increased. Rice, kaladi, sweet potatoes,
and Indian corn and sago are the principal food <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150">150</a>]</span>products cultivated. Tobacco, cotton, sugar-cane, tapioca, and fruit are also grown
here.
</p>
<p>The implements used for purposes of land culture in the island are of the most rude
description. On the plains of Menkabong, Tawaran, and Tampassuk, near the coast, ploughs
and harrows drawn by buffaloes are employed, and their produce is carried to market
in light bamboo sledges. Further inland, however, the implements are yet more primitive,
nearly all the necessary labour of cultivation being performed with a blunt-pointed
iron chopper, or a sharp-pointed bamboo.
</p>
<p>The hoe, another implement used, may be taken as the type of that adopted by the Chinese
emigrants in the Straits Settlements and Eastern Archipelago generally; indeed, wherever
a Chinaman sets his foot in a new locality for cultural purposes, a chopper and a
blade or two of his national &#x201c;chunkal&#x201d; or spade-hoe are sure to form a part of his
extremely small belonging. He sets to work cutting the brushwood and small timber
on his future clearing, and piling this at the base of the large trees, he fires the
whole until only a few great black stumps, and here and there a gaunt leafless durian
or dryobalanops remains of the old forest. Now, the &#x201c;chunkal&#x201d; is used to stir the
virgin soil by chopping it up, a much quicker process than digging; indeed, a spade
would have no chance in a competition where, as in this case, the soil is full of
roots. If desirable, the soil can be thus chopped up to a depth of 12 in. or 14 in.,
the only drawback being that the operator stands on the freshly cultivated land. Armed
with a chopper and one of these spade-hoes, a solitary Chinaman will not unfrequently
build a miserable little palm-leaf hut on a well-watered bit of forest near a river,
and in a month or two he will have cleared several acres, to which, when planted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151">151</a>]</span>with gambier or pepper, he looks for a fair return. Here, alone in the forest, or
at the best with a companion or two equally poor as himself, he subsists on a little
boiled rice, until his crops of sweet potatoes, bananas, sugar-cane, egg fruit, maize,
and yams, are fit for use; for one of his first cares has been to clear the bit of
land around his hut, on which to plant the few roots and seeds which he has brought
with him, most probably the gift of one of his richer countrymen, perchance of the
trader of whom he bought the bag of rice, which with a little freshly caught fish
from the river, are the only &#x201c;stores&#x201d; which stand between him and starvation, until
his garden produce is available. I have often come across these clearings right in
the heart of the forest, miles away from any other human habitation, and have been
as much astonished at the amount of labour performed with such a simple tool, as the
thrifty labourer himself was to see me.
</p>
<p>The Dusun villagers keep bees and export wax in quantity, and most of the tribes collect
the varied natural products of the sea or of the forests in their respective districts.
The Sulus were until quite recently a warlike race inhabiting the large island of
Sulu, between Borneo and the Philippines. They were independent and ruled by a Sultan,
who held Sulu, Tawi Tawi, and the north of Borneo, including the fine harbour of Sandakan.
The Sulus, however, are now practically under the Manilla Government. Slavery, although
not yet abolished in Borneo, is not nearly so common as was formerly the case. The
native government at Brunei is practically under the eye of the British governor of
Labuan, and thus many former abuses have become mitigated merely by the moral influence
of a British colony being located thus near to the capital.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152">152</a>]</span></p>
<p>It must not be imagined that either the Malays or the native Borneans are the bloodthirsty
savages they are sometimes made out to be. The Malays generally are courteous, dignified,
and hospitable. Many of them have made long journeys for purposes of trade, and have
a tolerably good idea of the manners and customs of Europeans. Others have taken to
the use of European commodities after observing them used by the Chinese traders and
settlers, and one can rarely visit a native of any consideration without finding him
the hospitable possessor of a chair or two, plates, dishes, water bottles and glasses,
and very often of excellent brandy and cigars. They are most sensitive, innately polite
and gentle in manners, and very quick to understand and appreciate any little courtesies
or civilities one may offer them. All but the poorest carry their national weapon,
&#x201c;the murderous crease,&#x201d; a sort of long sinuous-edged dagger, generally as sharp as
a razor, and most deadly when wielded by a skilful hand. In many cases where the owners
are rich or of high rank these weapons are beautifully finished&#x2014;rarely damascened&#x2014;and
the handles of ivory or gold set with pearls, diamonds, and other precious stones.
The running &#x201c;amok,&#x201d; so often cited as an instance of their savage bloodthirsty nature
is really a very rare occurrence, and is generally attributed to the excessive use
of opium, or to some great disappointment or dishonour having befallen the frantic
creature who, drawing his kriss, rushes at friend and foe alike until either shot
down like a mad dog or run through the body with a spear. Jealousy is the main cause
of all the bloodshed of which the Malays are guilty. The co-respondent in Borneo must
either have a tacit understanding with the husband or rather proprietor of the frail
one, or his adventures may end very suddenly. I saw one man in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153">153</a>]</span>the hospital at Labuan who paid the penalty of his indiscretion. One night a kriss
or spear had been driven into his thigh through the interstices of the floor of the
house in which he was sleeping with his Helen, and with such force that the bone was
completely severed. It is possible the weapon was poisoned, at any rate he died some
little time afterwards, notwithstanding all that surgical skill could suggest. In
the case of the Malays their women are, as a rule, secluded from the gaze of strangers
in private apartments, but in the interior the women of the aboriginal tribes enjoy
equal freedom with the men, and often join in discussions and trading difficulties
with great tact. Monogamy is the rule with the Borneans and polygamy with the Malays.
In Borneo, as in Europe, the female exceeds the male population, and here, too, the
women do a large proportion of the field labour in addition to their domestic duties.
</p>
<p>Some of the little villages of the native tribes inland present a pleasant and prosperous
exterior. Little palm-leaf houses stand here and there beneath groves of cocoa-nut
trees, betel-palms, tree-ferns, or graceful willow-like bamboo. Breadths of fresh
greensward occur among the clumps of low brush or scrubby vegetations, the remains
of the old jungle, and here buffaloes or goats, and occasionally other cattle, browse
around the houses. Pigs, bees, and poultry are domesticated, and are often very abundant.
The houses are built on piles, and a sloping hill-side or knoll is generally selected
as a site, so that all superfluous surface water may readily escape. The fowls are
caught every evening and placed in open-work baskets of either rattan or bamboo, suspended
beneath the eaves of the houses. This care is essential in order to guard them from
the attacks of large snakes and iguanas, or other poultry-stealing saurians.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154">154</a>]</span></p>
<p>The main food product is rice, of which two distinct races are grown. One kind only
prospers in the rich alluvial deposits of the valleys near the streams, where it can
be irrigated at particular stages of its growth. The other kind, or &#x201c;hill-rice,&#x201d; will
grow on the hills up to 3000 feet elevation, and prospers in dry red earth, and when
growing it closely resembles a barley-field at home. One of the most important of
the women&#x2019;s duties is to clean and prepare daily the &#x201c;padi&#x201d; or rice in the husk, which,
with fish and fruit, forms the main food supply of these islanders. The &#x201c;padi&#x201d; is
placed in large wooden mortars and beaten with wooden pestles a yard or more in length.
This beating or pounding separates the husk from the white grain within. It is a very
pretty sight to see the girls of the villages inland thus engaged. As many as three
may sometimes be seen beating the rice in one of these large wooden mortars. With
one hand they grasp the pestle about the centre, while the other hand is rested on
the hip. One woman commences to beat the rice with a steady, regular stroke, then
another one joins her, and then a third. Of course, the most exact time has to be
observed, and the graceful motions of their slightly-draped figures, the dancing pestles,
and the regular thudding sounds produced, are very interesting to a stranger. After
the rice has been sufficiently beaten, one of the girls scoops it out of the mortar
with her little hands into a shallow tray of closely-woven rattan work of circular
form and about two feet in diameter. Standing on the verandah or platform between
the houses so as to catch the breeze, the rice is sifted, and now and then dexterously
thrown up into the air so that the chaff and refuse is blown away, but the rice falls
back into the tray. When finished the rice is as clean and as white as that dressed
by the finest machinery in England. Two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155">155</a>]</span>or three girls will soon clean the day&#x2019;s supply, and by the laughing and gossip indulged
in one may infer that the task is not a very unpleasant one to them.
</p>
<p>The farther one proceeds inland the more extensive are the clearings devoted to rice
culture. This is accounted for by the fact that near the coast rice is often imported
in exchange for jungle produce, but far inland the natives are obliged to grow all
the food they require, and in some cases as in the district to the south of Kina Balu
most of the hills up to 3000 feet are either under rice culture, or are lying fallow,
covered with low brushwood or jungle. Virgin land or old forests are rare here, unless
on the slopes of the great mountain itself. The clothing of the aboriginals is in
most cases very scanty, now and then &#x201c;sarongs&#x201d; and white calico are obtained from
the coast in return for wax, gutta, tobacco, or other produce of the hills, but, as
a rule, the clothing of the native tribes of the north of Borneo inland is a short
&#x201c;sarong&#x201d; made of a strong indigo-dyed cloth, which is woven by the women from the
strong fibres of the &#x201c;Lamba&#x201d; (<i lang="la">Curculigo latifolia</i>), a yellow-flowered broad-leaved weed, often seen in great abundance on old cultivated
plots near the houses. Many of the men, especially those of the Murut tribes, who
are perhaps the most primitive of all the northern Borneans, wear nothing but a strip
of bark-cloth or &#x201c;chawat&#x201d; around the loins, and I have no doubt but that this was
the first clothing ever worn by the natives of the island. This bark-cloth is the
produce of <i lang="la">Artocarpus elastica</i>, a tall tree with a trunk two feet in diameter, and leaves closely resembling those
of the bread-fruit, but rough instead of glossy. The inner bark is stripped off and
soaked in water, being afterwards beaten to render it soft and pliable. Of this &#x201c;chawats&#x201d;
or loin-cloths and jackets <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>are commonly made by the Muruts on the Lawas and the Limbang rivers, and it is also
still used by the Dusan villagers on the Tampassuk, notwithstanding their skill in
preparing, weaving, and dyeing the &#x201c;Lamba&#x201d; fibre.
</p>
<p>The native women inland wear short &#x201c;sarongs&#x201d; of &#x201c;Lamba&#x201d; cloth reaching from the waist
nearly to their knees, and a profusion of stained rattan coils, brass wire, coloured
beads, and other trinkets around their waists, and heavy rings of brass on their legs,
or coils of brass wire on their plump and dusky arms. The younger ones wear a strip
of dark cloth across the breast. All have glossy black hair and dark eyes. Some of
the Murut women are fine muscular creatures, and either in boats or afield they appear
to be as strong and active as the men. Their hair is often very gracefully wreathed
up with a string of red or amber-coloured beads, sometimes with a strip of the pale
yellow nipa leaf in its young state, and the colour contrast is then very effective.
The physique of the inland tribes, especially of the Dyaks, Kayans, and Muruts, is
superior to that of the Malays. The Kayans and Muruts are especially lithe and active&#x2014;bronzy,
straight-limbed, and statuesque. This is the result of an active life spent hunting
in the forest, climbing after gutta, rubber, jungle-fruit, or beeswax, or in cultivating
the clearings around their dwellings, or in fishing in the rivers. The aboriginals
are active, while, as a class, the Malays are lethargic and luxurious, and rarely
exert themselves or make long foot journeys unless actually compelled to do so, and
the richer ones spend much of their time in opium smoking or with their women instead
of trying to ameliorate the condition of their poorer neighbours, who in one way or
another have to &#x201c;pay the piper.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>It is sad to see such a lovely and fertile island impoverished <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157">157</a>]</span>to a great extent by the avaricious Malays, who ought to encourage the natives to
improve themselves and the country in which they live, instead of which they wring
their property from them whenever possible under all manner of pretences. The harsh
treatment to which the aboriginals, and even the poorer of the Malays, were formerly
subjected by the petty chiefs and Pangerans, is now much moderated, as many natives
have visited Labuan, and it has now become known as a sanctuary from their unjust
oppressors.
</p>
<p>The climate of Borneo although hot and wet, is fairly healthy, especially on the hills
inland, where the air is much fresher and cooler than on the lowlands near the coast;
the mean annual temperature is about 84°. The hot and dry monsoon lasts from December
to May, and the cool and wet one from June to November; the rainfall is very heavy,
especially on the hills. The economic products for which the soil and climate are
suitable are coffee, cinchona, cocoa, cotton, tobacco, sugar-cane, indigo, gambier,
cocoa-nuts for oil, and manilla hemp. Fine timber, gutta, caoutchouc, rattans, and
camphor, are the indigenous products of the forests primæval. Among the introduced
fruits which succeed well are oranges, limes, pomoloes, mangoes, pine-apples, and
bananas. The animal products are edible swallows&#x2019; nests, ivory, sea-slug or <i lang="fr">beche de mer</i>, (Holothuria), fine fish of many kinds, pearls, and pearl-shell. Among minerals,
coal, antimony, cinnabar, and gold seem the most promising; diamonds, tin, copper,
plumbago, and iron are reported; and if one may judge of the iron by the old weapons,
such as krisses, parongs, and spears as made by the Bruneis and the Kayans, it must
be of excellent quality.
</p>
<p>I made a pen and ink sketch of a Kayan war knife which I saw in the collection of
native weapons in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158">158</a>]</span>possession of Mr. Treacher at Government House, Labuan. Of this sketch Mr. Cooper
has made me this careful fac-simile on wood. It had a finely-tempered blade, ornamented
along the back for about half its length. One side of the blade was flat, the other
rounded; the sheath was elaborately carved and, as is generally the case in Borneo,
made of two flat pieces of wood bound tightly together by neatly worked rattan cane;
the hilt was ornamented with tufts of red and black hair, and it was furnished with
a girdle of rattan plaited&#x2014;altogether a most handy and formidable implement in the
paw of a lusty naked savage.
</p>

</div><p>
</p>
<p>Gold, diamonds, and antimony have been obtained in remunerative quantities at the
Sarawak mines, which were originally worked by the Chinese settlers, but are now in
the hands of a company. Mining operations are very difficult <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159">159</a>]</span>owing to the enormous rainfall; and it is only the abundance of cheap Chinese or native
labour which renders it possible in such a climate. Coolies from Hong Kong may be
obtained for seven to eight dollars per month, or for less if their food is provided;
and natives will work sometimes for five to seven dollars per month. A good Chinaman
as a labourer, is however worth two Malays.
</p>
<p>The largest rivers in the island are supposed to be the Kinabatangan and the Pontianak;
the former is said to be navigable over two hundred miles from its mouth, and at the
farthest point reached it was fifty yards wide, and there was seven fathoms of water.
Dutch steamers have ascended a long way inland up the Pontianak which lies south of
Sarawak. Most of the rivers on the north-west coast are very shallow, having dangerous
bars at their mouths; and that at the mouth of the Brunei was partly blocked by large
rocks about the time of the siege of that city by the English.
</p>
<p>Gambling and opium smoking are the bane of the Chinese settlers and of many of the
well-to-do Malays; and of all forms of intemperance surely this last must be the most
degrading and otherwise hurtful in its effects. The manufactured drug as imported
from Benares and other opium producing districts, is in the form of balls six inches
in diameter, covered with the dried petals of poppy flowers. This product is the inspissated
juice of the opium poppy (<i lang="la">Papaver somniferum</i>), and is of a dark brown or black colour. Before it is used for smoking, however,
it has to be still further prepared by boiling and stirring in shallow pans over a
bright fire; and as the pure product is very high in price, it is often subjected
to adulteration. In our eastern colonies it is usual to let or farm out the right
to prepare and sell or export opium <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160">160</a>]</span>to an enterprising native or Chinese merchant, and the revenue thus obtained is often
enormous as compared with that on spirits and tobacco, or other duty-paying goods.
</p>
<p>An opium-smoking establishment consists of a few gloomy rooms furnished with cane-bottomed
couches, and on little stands are the pipes, tiny lamps, and other implements used
by the smokers. The smell is generally sufficient to deter Europeans entering an opium-smoker&#x2019;s
haunt from motives of curiosity; or if under guidance one does venture into the ill-ventilated
and malodorous apartments behind, it is with feelings of relief that the sweet outer
air is again gained. The smokers lie on the bamboo couches, and a little stand is
brought, on which are one or two flute-like pipes, a pill or two of the drug, and
a little glass lamp. In some cases an attendant manipulates the drug and fills the
pipes; as a rule, however, this is done by the smokers themselves. There is no mistaking
an habitual opium smoker; his eyes are dull, his complexion sallow, and in general
a listless bearing, with a frame more or less emaciated, betokens his being a degraded
victim. Without a supply of his favourite drug he is miserable; and when under its
influence he is useless. Here he lies holding a morsel of the black drug on a needle
over the flame of the lamp, twirling it round and round, and toasting it in the flame
until the proper consistence is attained. It is then introduced into the pipe, and
the needle, on being withdrawn, leaves a tiny air-hole through the mass as it fits
like a plug in the bowl. The smoker now holds the bowl to the lamp, and obtains a
light, and then he draws a long whiff or two as the burning morsel of opium rapidly
decreases in the bowl.

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Brunei, the capital of Borneo and the seat of the government, is a water-city of about
twenty thousand inhabitants. The palm-thatched houses of which it for the most part
consists, are built on piles so as to be above the river at high tide. From one of
the adjacent low hills the view of this &#x201c;Venice of the East&#x201d; is a most novel one&#x2014;indeed,
unique in its way; and although the town is nearly fifteen miles from the mouth of
the river, yet a moderate-sized gunboat can anchor in the broad water-way in the very
centre of the city, and within a few yards of the Sultan&#x2019;s Istana. There is a rather
awkward bar at the entrance to the river. A trading steamer from Singapore calls here
once a month to bring letters and goods for the Sultan and a few Chinese merchants,
and to take back sago, which is the main export. In some cases the blocks of houses
are connected by bridges formed of long palm stems lashed together with rattans; but,
as a rule, all general communication <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162">162</a>]</span>must be carried on by boats. Some of the inhabitants grow a few flowers and herbs
in boxes of earth; and occasionally papaw trees and gourds of different kinds are
thus cultivated. Little rafts, or floating tree-trunks, are moored to the piles which
support the houses for the accommodation of ducks and fowls.
</p>
<p>The market held on the river every morning is one of the most singular sights of the
place. Here you may see a hundred or more little boats containing fruit, fish, rice,
and other produce, for sale or barter. Among the petty traders the Brunei women are
most prominent, and many of them present a most singular appearance, the hats they
wear being made of neatly plaited Nipa leaves, and being from two to three feet in
diameter, they serve the purpose of both head covering and umbrella, and they screen
the whole body of the wearer from the hot sun. Most of the women to be seen in the
market are old and coarse featured&#x2014;in many cases positively ugly&#x2014;reminding one of
the orang utan as they glance at you from beneath their wrinkled foreheads, their
mouths overflowing with <span class="corr" id="xd29e2149" title="Source: betel nut-juice">betel-nut juice</span> the while, their repulsive black teeth being worn off level with their gums; their
more beautiful sisters are secluded according to the etiquette of Islam; the nobles
and richer Malays have wives and slaves in abundance. A European lady who visited
the court here and was admitted into the women&#x2019;s apartments, tells me that some are
passing fair, with tiny hands and feet, straight noses and liquid eyes, prototypes
of those black-eyed damsels who are to attend all true believers of the Prophet in
the gardens of Paradise.
</p>
<p>The principal traders are Chinamen, who have floating warehouses singularly like the
Noah&#x2019;s arks of early memory. Brunei is the Sheffield of north-west Borneo, the manufacture
of knives, parongs and krisses being <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163">163</a>]</span>largely carried on; and on one of the little islands is a primitive foundry where
gongs, brass guns, cooking-pots, betel boxes, &amp;c., are cast. Some of these articles
are ornamented with well-designed figures in relief, and would not be any disgrace
to a European manufacturer. The models and methods of casting are singularly like
those of our own artizans. I visited one rude armourer&#x2019;s shop, and much admired the
exquisite finish of some weapons he had made. The peculiar long swivel guns or small
cannon cast here are now rarely used, except as currency, being valued at about thirty
dollars per cwt. In the good old times slaves could be purchased here at thirty dollars,
or a picul of gun-metal each; but at the present time the Malays complain of the low
purchasing power of money&#x2014;<i>i.e.</i> of brass guns&#x2014;just as do most people nearer home.
</p>
<p>The Sultan&#x2019;s palace or Istana, like nearly all the other dwellings here, is built
on piles over the water, and is a shabby, tumble-down looking establishment. In front
is a large audience chamber, containing a few old gilt framed mirrors and silvered
globes, and there are, on occasion, a round table and a few rickety chairs. The Sultan
himself is now an old man, over eighty, and so avaricious that he will do anything
for the sake of a few dollars.
</p>
<p>The Government here is corrupt, and, indeed, but little more than nominal; and if
his people of the outlying districts refuse to pay tribute, or to obey his mandates,
he has no means of enforcing his demands. He has a good many wives, and female slaves
or concubines, but no children. I visited the palace in company with Mr. Peter Veitch
and Inche Mahomed, the British Consular agent at this port. We were honoured with
an audience by His Highness. His two nephews, Pangeran Matassan and Pangeran Anak
Bazar, were present, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164">164</a>]</span>and welcomed us before the Sultan appeared. They were intelligent men, and it was
a pleasure to hear Malay spoken by them in all its purity. Tea was offered us, together
with the long Nipa leaf cheroots so largely smoked by Malays and Borneans of all grades.
</p>
<p>In about five minutes His Highness appeared, dressed in a long Arab coat, a sarong,
and having a small black cap on his head. That the portraits of Pope Pius IX. resemble
him very much has repeatedly been observed by visitors here. He walked slowly, bearing
rather heavily, as I thought, on a long staff, which had two short prongs at the lower
extremity. He came forward, and we shook hands, after which he sat down in an arm-chair
on the opposite side of the table. He told us that he was now a very old man, and
that every day found him weaker. I thanked him for a passport he had given me some
months before for the journey inland to Kina Balu.
</p>
<p>He seemed interested in hearing of the great mountain, and asked several questions.
He appeared astonished to hear it was so cold there; and inquired as to the tobacco
and rice crops. He also expressed his regret that being now old and infirm, he could
not undertake a journey to the mountain himself, of which, he observed, he had heard
several accounts derived from natives who had accompanied Mr. Low and Mr. St. John.
</p>
<p>On leaving the Sultan&#x2019;s, we visited a foundry situated near the house of the minister
of war or the Tumongong; also the house of a gold worker, who made most of the trinkets,
rings, and ear ornaments worn by the Brunei ladies. The proprietor, an old man, showed
us some prettily designed specimens of native gold work, the ear ornaments being especially
singular. It is the fashion for many of the ladies of Brunei and the interior to cut
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165">165</a>]</span>a large gash in the lobe of each ear, and in these holes are inserted gold or silver
ornaments, as large as a wine cork. If of gold, they are mostly made of beaten work;
the highly decorated convex ends, however, are generally cast in little moulds formed
of clay and wax, or dammar. The crucibles used for melting the metal are of the size
and shape of half a hen&#x2019;s egg, being formed of fine porous clay. These are heated
over tiny charcoal fires, the heat being augmented with a blow-pipe.
</p>
<p>In some of the ornaments we observed rudely cut rock crystals, or Bornean diamonds;
and part of a waist-belt contained a dozen fine pearls, but most of their beauty was
lost by bad setting. The stock in trade of a gold-worker here is of the most simple
description. A rough block of hard wood serves as a bench or anvil, and is perforated
with large and small holes, into which iron pins of various sizes are inserted for
various uses. Hammers of iron and wood, a chisel or two, a pair of shears, wax and
clay for models, or matrices and earthen crucibles for melting up the Spanish gold
pieces, are all the plant he deems necessary.
</p>
<p>There is not much originality in the designs used. Some of the Brunei ladies must
have fingers of the most delicate proportions to be able to wear some of the rings
I saw here for repair. Smiths&#x2019; shops are pretty much the same all over the world.
We visited one here, and except that iron and tools were less plentiful, it was pretty
much like a village smithy in England. Sheffield files and rasps are used even in
this out-of-the-way part of the East. Most other tools were of Brunei make. Choppers,
knives, parongs, and krisses represent the manufactures. A Bornean bellows is peculiar,
being made of two upright wooden cylinders four or five feet high, and connected at
the bottom with the iron pipe <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166">166</a>]</span>which enters the fuel. In each cylinder is a wooden disk edged with soft feathers
stuck on with glue, and to each a piston rod of wood is attached. A man standing behind
the cylinders works them up and down alternately, and in this way a constant current
of air is supplied to the fire. The old smith was much struck with a breech-loading
Reilly shot gun Mr. Veitch had with him, and he took the trouble to go across a rickety
bridge of bamboo into his dwelling-house to fetch a parong, or Brunei sword, of which
he asked our opinion. Considering the rude appliances of this primitive smithy, the
sword, in fine damascene work and finish, was perhaps as wonderful in its way as the
gun. On returning to the ship, which was anchored in the river below the town, we
saw a gathering of natives on a grassy knoll a little above the old ruined Consulate,
and were informed that a public execution was going on. It appears a China trader
had been murdered and robbed on the Trusan river, and two of the Trusan Muruts had
been arrested, and were being executed for the crime, although it was by some thought
that the murder had actually been committed by Brunei men. At any rate, of these poor
Muruts scapegoats were made. A grave was dug beneath a tree, and a noose connected
with a bit of board was passed over their heads. A stout stick was now inserted in
the rope, and two or three turns&#x2014;Spanish winch fashion&#x2014;finished the poor fellows&#x2019;
existence, whether innocent or guilty. We did not land, but watched the proceedings
as well as we could from the bridge of the vessel with glasses. Summary justice is
the rule here.
</p>
<p>Just afterwards a ship came here and anchored in the river. It was very hot, and at
night the ports were left open to secure ample ventilation. In the morning a gold
watch and a revolver were missing. The thieves had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167">167</a>]</span>dropped down the river silently in a boat and taken advantage of the darkness to put
their hands in at the ports and take all they could reach. A complaint was made to
the Sultan at once. In a few days the goods were recovered, and word was also brought
to the effect that each of the offenders had lost one of their hands for the offence.
Of course nothing so severe as this was anticipated when the charge was made, and
no one more regretted the cruelty than those who were so near being losers by the
dishonesty of the maimed sufferers. The principal export product is sago, of which
large quantities are brought down from the Limbang and other rivers in the interior.
There are two large sago-washing establishments in the town, both the property of
intelligent and hospitable Chinamen. Gutta-percha, caoutchouc, edible birds&#x2019;-nests,
camphor, rattans, and fine timber are also obtained in small quantities from the forests
of the country behind. Fine fish is obtained from the river by the natives, and fruit
is very plentiful in season. Excellent drinking-water is obtained from some rocks
beside the river between the town and the old Consulate. It is pure, cool, fresh,
and abundant, inestimable qualities in such a hot and thirst-producing climate.
</p>
<p>We visited one of the sago factories, and found their water remarkably good; and when
I and Mr. Veitch went out one evening snipe and pigeon-shooting on a plain behind
we came across an aqueduct formed of large bamboo stems, in which this water was conveyed
from a spring nearly a mile away. I was very much interested in the old Chinaman&#x2019;s
garden, which contained a fair assortment of fruits and flowers. The lively white-flowered
<i lang="la">Pancratium zeylanicum</i> was blooming beautifully in one of the well-watered beds. The mangoes were large,
and of excellent flavour. In exploring the garden behind the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168">168</a>]</span>house I came across our host&#x2019;s coffin standing on supports in one of the sheds. It
was large and curiously shaped, and made of some dark durable wood highly valued by
the wealthy Chinese. Most Chinese settlers here, when sufficiently wealthy, send to
China for one of these coffins, which is preserved until their death. Nearly all the
Chinese settlers here in the capital are married to Malay women, and healthy children
generally result from these unions. On the other hand, the Malay or Bornean women
rarely bear children when married to Europeans, and if so, the children are generally
unhealthy, and they themselves rarely have offspring. No doubt the Malays of the capital
are gradually becoming absorbed by intermarrying with the native Bornean women of
the Murut, Kadyan, and other inland tribes. Many of the Malays, so called, closely
resemble the aboriginals in physiognomy, and the common people or Bruneis may be characterised
as an ugly and immoral lot of mongrels. Now and then traces of African blood are seen.
</p>
<p>Nowhere else in Borneo are the men such liars and thieves as here, and the Brunei
women have been described by a former writer as being perhaps &#x201c;the most immoral in
the whole world.&#x201d; Of classical celebrities, Cato and Phryne are certainly well represented
in this great water city of the far East. The climate is sultry. A large upas tree
is pointed out to all comers, and it is a fine specimen, standing on the right bank
of the river, just below the town, near some ancient tombs. A burial-ground, indeed,
occupies nearly the whole right bank of the river from just beyond the Consulate as
far as the sago factory. One or two of the tombs are large, and built of stone, with
entrance gates; but most are small, with perhaps only a large stone to mark the spot.
</p>
<p>The capital, as also the towns all along the coast, <span class="corr" id="xd29e2189" title="Source: suffer">suffers</span> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169">169</a>]</span>now and then from epidemic diseases, cholera and small-pox being the most common.
Senõr Quateron, the old padre, now resident in Labuan, formerly had a mission here,
and the remains of his chapel still stand on the left bank of the Brunei river, a
little below the town. As seen coming down the stream, it forms a picturesque object,
a white campanile standing on a grassy knoll, the blue peaks of Molu towering up into
the sky behind. I should think that Brunei, of all other places in Borneo, is the
last at which missionaries of any denomination would be likely to succeed. Their sphere
is not with Mahomedans, whose faith is good, so far as it teaches cleanliness and
temperance; but with the aboriginals of the interior, who are thrifty, honest, and
truthful to a fault, and who have no systematic faith unless their belief in the cries
and motions of birds and animals, and other omens can be so called. With these people
missionaries would doubtless be successful, but they must be hard-working men who
could teach these gentle savages the benefits of civilisation without introducing
its vices.
</p>
<p>A missionary has thus recorded his impressions of life among the natives near Sarawak:&#x2014;&#x201c;A
message came to me from one of the Christians on the Kabo, asking me to go up and
see them. Accordingly, as soon as I could get a boat ready we were on our way down
the Sebetan river .&#x2026; the wild, sombre, solitary feeling of the <span class="corr" id="xd29e2196" title="Source: primeval">primæval</span> forest, the easy motion of the boat, the cheeriness of the paddling Dyaks, united
to produce a sensation of repose and awe.&#x2026;. Next morning we soon came to the first
waterfall rushing and roaring over the rocks. Here we had to halt and stow away the
palm-leaf awnings, and pull the boat over the fall. Then one could not help feeling
the charms of tropical scenery,&#x2014;the clear stream running over a pebbly bottom, rocks
here and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>there with occasional tufts of vegetation forming little islets in mid river, hills
on each bank running down perpendicularly to the water&#x2019;s edge and covered with creepers,
moss, wild palms, and ferns, magnificent trees on either side stretching their branches
into triumphal arches <span class="corr" id="xd29e2201" title="Source: over head">overhead</span>. Soon the whole scene was changed, clouds gathered, and thunder rumbled, and down
came the rain in a continuous torrent. Towards evening we arrived at our destination
like so many drowned rats. In the evening I held service under difficulties, there
being no prayer-house, and the long public verandah of the house being the only available
place. The dignity of worship suffers terribly in such circumstances. No sooner do
we begin than dogs begin to fight, or a child to cry, or an unsympathetic heathen
at the other end of the house to make some discordant row, or a fighting cock will
fly right into the midst of the kneeling assembly, and distract everyone&#x2019;s attention.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The condition of the natives near the capital is not nearly so good as at Kina Balu,
a hundred and fifty miles away, if we except the Kadyans, who being Mahomedans, and
having powerful friends in Brunei, are able to resist many of the taxes which the
Muruts of the Limbang and elsewhere are called upon to pay. I made two visits here
to the capital, and made a boat journey up the Limbang and Pandarowan rivers as far
as Bukit Sagan. This trip was made in the wet season, and took twelve men three days,
owing to the heavy freshes against which they had to pull. The Pandarowan river is
small compared with the Limbang, of which it is a tributary; but it is, without exception,
the loveliest river I ever saw. At the end of the second day after leaving the capital
we reached a large house belonging to the Muruts of this district. It stood in a little
clearing close beside the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171">171</a>]</span>stream, and was nearly a hundred yards in length. A rude pathway of tree trunks lay
on the muddy shore reaching to one end of the building. We landed here to cook our
dinner, and clambered up into the house by a rude stair formed of a notched tree trunk.
The Muruts looked rather surprised to see such visitors, but spread mats for us, and
gave us some firewood and water. After dinner we had a smoke with the head-man, a
fine muscular old fellow, nearly six feet high. About fifty men, women, and children
swarmed round the circle, of which a wood fire was the centre, to get a peep at us.
The head-man&#x2019;s wife was a young and rather handsome girl, having a fine dusky little
baby swung behind her, and several other of the younger married women and girls were
comely, with dark eyes and luxuriant hair. Others, however, were less attractive,
and many of both sexes were troubled with peculiar skin diseases. We engaged two men
of this tribe to go with us as far as Bukit Sagan, as our men did not exactly know
the best place at which to land. We slept by the fire until about two o&#x2019;clock, when
the rain, which had been coming down heavily all day, ceased, and the silver moon
being nearly at the full, it quite illumined the stream as it sped past the house.
The mosquitoes became very troublesome, and so I called the men and went down to the
boat. After shouting for about half an hour, the Muruts came down and took their places;
and pulling across the current, we crept up stream beneath the arching plumes of the
Nipa palm, which is here abundant. It was hard work for the men, although we had now
fourteen paddles. A sharp look-out had to be kept for snags and floating trunks of
trees, several of which we saw shooting past us mid stream. Our Labuan men were rather
afraid, and several times wanted to make fast until daybreak. At one place the boat
struck heavily <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>and keeled over in an alarming way, but we found the obstruction was a raft of the
stems of the sago palm, which some Muruts had felled and lashed near the bank ready
for floating down to their rude washing-sheds below. This heavy bump woke up our men,
several of whom had previously been dozing, although paddling the while, and we got
along for a mile or two in first-rate style. Then, in crossing the current, at an
awkward bend we were well-nigh washed away; indeed, had it not been for the silent
but strenuous exertions of our Murut guides, the alligators would possibly have had
a feed. The stream for the moment got the better of our men, but by a clever touch
of the paddle our guides steered us through safely, and a steady pull for an hour
longer brought us to the foot of the hill where we were to land. We made our rattan-rope
fast to a tree, and slept until nearly daybreak. One man told us in the morning that
he had not slept a wink all night, as he was afraid our &#x201c;painter&#x201d; would part; but
it stood the strain well, although the boat had swung about and tugged a good deal,
owing to the swift current running down. The scene at sunrise was lovely; every stem
and leaf was covered with dew-drops, and the hazy golden mist, through which palms,
tree-ferns, and curious leafage of all descriptions loomed out more and more plainly
until we saw everything in the foreground quite distinctly. It was a transformation
scene on a gigantic scale, and its loveliness was such as only Turner at his best
could have portrayed. The delicate arching outline of the nebong palms was sharply
defined against the sky overhead, and large masses of a wild musa fringed both banks
with immense leaves and clusters of delicate rosy bracts.
</p>
<p>How comes it that none of our good landscape-painters ever visit the tropics, where
the beauty of form and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173">173</a>]</span>colour in the landscapes is more glorious than anywhere else, and yet nearly all the
tropical pictures one sees remind one of the daubs of a bad scene-painter? Here and
there clumps of bamboo reminded one of the early summer freshness of the weeping willow
beside the silvery trout streams at home. A gorgeous <span class="corr" id="xd29e2214" title="Source: scarlet flowered">scarlet-flowered</span> climbing bauhinia draped some of the low trees which nestled down near the water.
We turned out for a ramble with our guns while our people cooked breakfast. I never
saw birds so numerous in Borneo before. The first shot brought down a little green
tree-pigeon, with a magenta stain on its white breast and on its head. A Kadyan boy
we had with us blazed away with an old Tower musket to his heart&#x2019;s content, and surprised
us by bringing in a long-tailed rufous-brown species of pigeon, which we had first
secured in the Sulu Islands. Two or three other rare Bornean birds were obtained.
Breakfast over, we set about climbing. Our path lay through the tall forest, and in
places the undergrowth was so thick that our guides and men had to cut us a path with
their parongs. For the first mile or two vegetation was scanty, but as we ascended
ferns and selaginellas became more plentiful. We stayed here and there to examine
fallen trees for epiphytal orchids, which however were far from abundant. About half
way up the hill we came to a gorge, down which a considerable body of water flows,
but it is screened from sight by huge boulders, which lie near together, forming a
sort of &#x201c;giant&#x2019;s causeway,&#x201d; across which we picked our way. We peered down the chasms,
but could not catch a glimpse of the stream, although we could hear it quite plainly
as it forced its way among the stones far below. In one wet spot several species of
aroids formed a little colony all to themselves. Of those collected in flower, one
proved <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174">174</a>]</span>distinct enough to be made the type of a new genus when submitted to the botanical
authorities at Kew. It grew in tufts on wet mossy stones, forming rather compact plants
a foot in height. The spathe is of a bright rose colour, borne on a scape nearly as
long as the leaves. I was especially interested in this plant, as I had seen a species
singularly like it beside the Haya Haya stream at the foot of Kina Balu. As we approached
the summit, we were stopped at one place by a perpendicular wall of sandstone rock,
and we had to make a wearisome detour in order to gain the crest. I had been led to
explore this hill at all risks, having been told by natives that a golden large-flowered
phalænopsis was here to be found, but after a hot and weary search on rock and tree
alike, no trace of any species of this genus could be found; and as I afterwards offered
my informants a month&#x2019;s wages if they would bring me a flower of it without any result,
I am inclined to think the thing a myth, like its &#x201c;bright scarlet&#x201d; congener. The only
thing which consoled me for my disappointment was a beautiful golden-blossomed dendrobium,
which has always been rare in our gardens; and I was also enabled to collect a large
number of <i lang="la">Vanda Hookeri</i>. This last is the &#x201c;Golden Duck&#x201d; orchid of the Brunei Malays, and exists in quantity
in the marshes near the river, and always, so far as I saw it, epiphytal, on a slender-stemmed
red-fruited pandan.
</p>
<p>This hill is not above five or six hundred feet above the sea, and yet on its crest
the air was quite fresh and cool. We obtained extensive views from the top over a
well-wooded country. Neither pitcher plants nor rhododendrons were seen, although
both exist abundantly on the Lawas hills, only a few miles away. In descending a wide
detour was made through the forest in search of plants, but distinct forms were rare.
On reaching the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175">175</a>]</span>boat we bathed, and changed our clothes, which was necessary, as we were drenched
to the skin, and covered with dirt from the half-rotten tree-trunks, over which we
had scrambled. It was about three o&#x2019;clock, of course very hot; and our boat formed
quite an attraction to the bees, butterflies, and some lovely blue day-flying moths,
which fluttered in the sunshine. The wild bees were indeed rather troublesome; and
some of the men who were nervous at their proximity, and began to buffet them, were
stung. As we ate our luncheon of boiled rice and jam, they frequently settled on our
plates, but they did not attack us.
</p>
<p>The journey down the river was an easy and pleasant one. The water, which had been
so high and turbid the night before, had now regained its proper level, and except
exactly amid stream the surface was as smooth as a mirror. The curving nipa leaves
and other vegetation were most sharply reflected from the placid surface, so clearly
indeed, that one could scarcely see where reality ended, and the shadow began. The
presence of the nipa palm beside the banks of eastern rivers, is almost always evidence
of deep water. In the shallow parts the pink-blossomed banana and bauhinia-draped
trees were most beautiful, here and there varied by elegant groups of pandanus. We
stayed at intervals to examine the vegetation more closely, and did not reach the
Murut settlement before nightfall.
</p>
<p>We paid off our guides, and stayed here an hour or two to rest our men. We slept in
the boat, and found the mosquitoes very voracious. When the moon rose we continued
our journey. In Bornean travel, near the coast, boats form the best conveyance. There
are no horses, nor indeed roads suitable for them; so that all journeys inland must
be performed on foot. Buffaloes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176">176</a>]</span>may in some places be obtained. If no heavy loads have to be carried, however, one
may travel quicker without them, except where deep and rapid flowing streams have
to be forded, and there they are most useful.
</p>
<p>We stayed at one little sago station, where the natives were preparing the raw product.
The process is very simple. The trees are cut down just as they attain maturity, the
time being known by the production of the branched inflorescence. The leaves are removed,
and then the trunks, which are ten to fifteen feet long, and as thick as a man&#x2019;s body,
are split longitudinally into two halves. A man then cuts out the pith, with which
the whole centre of the trunk is filled. This requires some skill. The implement employed
for the purpose is an axe, formed of a bamboo-stem, fixed in a stout wooden handle,
and lashed with rattan. By repeated strokes of this instrument the pith and fibres
are scooped out in thin layers, care being taken to cut it out as free from lumps
as possible. The pulped pith is then carried in baskets to a washing apparatus. This
consists of a rudely-constructed vat, elevated on piles, beside a river or brook,
whence fresh and clean water is plentifully obtainable.
</p>
<p>From the vat a spout conducts the water into a trough below. The bottom of the vat
is covered with a mat or bark-strainer. The pith is now placed in the vat, and trodden,
water being occasionally poured over it during the progress, and the result is that
the fine sago starch is washed through, and settles in the bottom of the trough below,
the coarse particles and other impurities being retained by the strainers, at the
bottom of the treading-vat. After the fine sago has been allowed time to settle in
the trough, the water is run off, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177">177</a>]</span>white putty-looking mass below is packed up in bags, and sold to the Chinamen, by
whom it is again washed and dried, previous to its being shipped to the Singapore
market. Two species of sago palm grow here, forming stout-stemmed trees, thirty or
forty feet in height. They are readily distinguished by the one having smooth bases
to the sheathing leaf-stalks, while the other has the leaf-sheaths set with stout
black spines. The smooth variety is most abundant. The dried leaf-sheaths of this
palm are utilised in the manufacture of neat baskets, being neatly sown together with
strips of rattan, and fitted with lids. Rattans are much used in house building, the
largest timbers being secured by their aid only.
</p>
<p>It is singular that pegs or nails are never used by the Malays, except in boat-building;
and the neatness and ingenuity with which rattan is used by these people is wonderful.
In one of the Kadyan villages, on the Lawas, I saw a violin, the back, front, and
sides of which were actually stitched together with slender strips of rattan. It had
been copied from a European model, and had a much better tone than one would expect
to find under the circumstances.
</p>
<p>The musical instruments made and used by the Malays and aboriginal Borneans are inferior
to those of Burmah and Siam, or even to those used by the Javanese. The pentatonic
scale is employed, and the music is monotonous and plaintive in its character. This
is especially true of the women&#x2019;s songs, which are mostly of a dirge-like kind. I
remember a Kadyan girl used to sing sometimes during my first visit to the Lawas,
and the effect at night more especially was extremely weird and melancholy. She had
a rich mellow voice, rising and falling in minor cadences, and dying away sweetly
tremulous as a silver bell. This poor girl&#x2019;s life, however, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178">178</a>]</span>ended suddenly. She usually walked through the clearing every day into the forest
beyond to fetch in fire-wood. One day she did not return as usual, and a search was
made for her along the paths in the neighbourhood without success. Some men who were
returning from gutta collecting, however, found her lying beneath a large tree, and
beside her was a large branch, recently broken off. It was supposed that this branch
had accidentally fallen, and struck her, so causing her death.
</p>
<p>Modifications of the &#x201c;cheng,&#x201d; or calabash pipes, are made both by the Kayans, on the
Baram river, and also by the Dusun villagers, near Kina Balu. There are distinct differences
between the instruments as made by each tribe. That from the Baram consists of seven
pipes; six arranged in a circle around a long central one, all seven being furnished
with a free reed at the base, where they are inserted in a calabash-gourd. Holes are
cut in the six outer pipes for fingering; the central pipe is, however, an open or
drone-pipe, the tone being intensified by fixing a loose cap of bamboo on the upper
end. It is played by blowing air into the neck of the gourd, or by drawing the breath
according to the effects desired. The Dusun pipes are formed of eight pipes, four
short, and equal in length, and four long and unequal. Reeds are cut at the lower
end in all the pipes, but the fingering is performed on the ends of the four equal
short pipes, there being no holes cut in the pipes for this purpose, as in the Kayan
instrument.
</p>
<p>I brought home examples of both varieties; and these are now in the Veitchian Museum
at Chelsea. Two or three varieties of flutes are made, also an instrument resembling
the old wooden flageolet, so common in England before the advent of the tin whistle.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179">179</a>]</span></p>
<p>McNair, in his work on Perak, mentions a curiosity, in the shape of an aëolian flute,
formed of a bamboo, in which holes are cut, so as to produce musical sounds when acted
on by the wind. An instrument like the Jew&#x2019;s harp is made of a single strip of bamboo;
and a curious stringed instrument is made of a joint of large yellow bamboo, the nine
or ten open strings of which produce notes similar to those of a banjo, when twanged
with the fingers. A specimen of this instrument may be seen in the Veitchian Museum
at Chelsea, together with one of similar design but of much more complicated and finer
make from Madagascar. Wooden drums, formed of hollow tree-trunks, and having goat
or deer-skin tightly stretched over the ends, are common, and of various sizes. The
old war-drums were made thus; but this instrument is now nearly obsolete, being to
a great extent replaced by metal gongs, of native manufacture certainly; but doubtless
the idea was copied from the Chinese.
</p>
<p>Nearly every trading prahu or boat carries one of these gongs; and the Muruts are
very fond of such music, and keep up an incessant din on these instruments at their
festivals. Sets of eight or ten small such are often fixed in a rattan and bamboo
frame, and beaten with two sticks, dulcimer fashion; and I have seen similar contrivances
formed of iron bars; and even strips of dry hard bamboo wood in the Sulu isles, the
scale in this case being similar to our own.
</p>
<p>It is very uncommon to hear performers playing in concert, unless in the case of gong-beating;
indeed, music is at a low ebb throughout the island. The songs of the boatman, on
the other hand, are often pleasing and melodious. A good many of their songs are Mahomedan
prayers, or chants; but occasionally the theme is on secular, and often very amusing
subjects. It is common <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180">180</a>]</span>for one man to strike up a song, improvising his subject as he sings, and then all
the crew laughingly join in the chorus. They keep time to the music in paddling; and
I always encouraged my boatmen to sing, as it relieves the monotony of the bump, bump
of the paddles against the side of the vessel, which becomes very tedious after the
first hour or two. One always has to be prepared for squalls when on the sea. They
are especially common at night, after very hot days. You see a black cloud lowering
on the horizon. Then a cool breeze fans your cheek. You at once strike all sail. The
breeze gets stronger and stronger, until you find yourself rocking about on a rough
&#x201c;choppy&#x201d; sea, amid a hurricane of wind and rain.
</p>
<p>Thunder and lightning are especially common during the wet monsoon. The mountains
behind &#x201c;Thunder and Lightning Bay,&#x201d; to the north of the capital, are often perfectly
illuminated by lightning flashes; and at times the thunder is deafening to hear. As
to the lightning latent flashes of electricity are visible most nights throughout
the year; and it is not uncommon to see a continuous play of lightning on the horizon,
especially after very sultry days. At times the sea is so highly phosphorescent, that
the boat leaves a wake of bright light in the water, and the paddles look as though
moving through a caldron of molten silver. This phenomenon is most commonly observable
after calm sultry weather.
</p>
<p>The sudden manner in which the rivers rise after heavy rain is wonderful; and the
flat forests beside or near the rivers often become flooded. You may go to bed at
night, and awake to find the native house in which you slept surrounded by acres of
water a yard deep in the morning. This is especially true of flat tracts, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181">181</a>]</span>through which streams flow near the great water-sheds inland. Considerable damage
results to the cultivated patches on the hills from these sudden rains; and formidable
land-slips not unfrequently take place on the steep hills near the rivers. Cultivation
near the capital is, however, of a poor description, compared with the plains of Menkabong,
Tawaran, and Tampassuk, or the hills further inland.
</p>
<p>A lover of nature who sees a tropical country for the first time, cannot help but
enjoy the bright light and heat, the vegetable glories of flower, fruit, and leaf,
called forth by the rain and sunshine&#x2014;of a clime where winter is unknown. And yet,
with all the sunshine and showers, the tropical blossoms are in a way aristocratic
and exclusive, and never mingle socially in bosky masses, as do our own wildings;
and it is not possible to name half-a-dozen of them that could at all compare with
the blue-bells, or heather, the buttercups, primroses, forget-me-nots, anemones, violets,
and rosy lychnis of our own cool moist woods and pastures.
</p>
<p>During a year&#x2019;s rambles in one of the richest and most fertile of tropical islands,
I saw nothing really fresh and spring-like; nothing like the &#x201c;green and gold&#x201d; of daffodils,
<span class="corr" id="xd29e2261" title="Source: aud">and</span> the tender young grass of April, or the royal glory of a summer iris, or an autumnal
crocus on its mossy bed. This much is ever lacking in the forest primæval; and even
in gardens&#x2014;Eastern gardens&#x2014;beautiful as they undoubtedly are in many ways, the sameness,
the cloying degree of permanency observable in the forests, becomes intensified, and
so still more unsatisfying. The plants seem always to present the same aspect; and
although most of them are at their best when revived by the rains, just after the
dry season, yet the charm of freshness is destroyed by the number of evergreens everywhere,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182">182</a>]</span>the driblets of bloom kept up by them nearly all the year round.
</p>
<p>Still the beauty of tropical gardens is lovely of its kind. You have, or may have,
all the tropical treasures of Kew&#x2014;palms, ferns, and orchids&#x2014;around you in the open
air; but all this is as the beauty of a lovely woman, jaded by over-enjoyment, the
whirl of a whole season&#x2019;s gaieties! There is elegance of form, and charm of colour,
all the refinement of cultured beauty, sure enough. Victoria water-lilies, and dainty
nymphæas in open air pools, the flesh-tinted blooms, and umbrageous leafage of the
sacred lotus also; the noble amherstia, with its pendants of crimson and gold,&#x2014;groves
of feathery-leaved palms&#x2014;all this, and very much more, is common; but it is astonishing
how soon one tires of this plethora of floral charms, and how eager becomes the longing
to sniff the homely fragrance of pinks and wall-flowers; to stoop for a violet from
a mossy hedge-bank, or a snow-drop even from a cotter&#x2019;s garden. Indeed, there is no
gainsaying the fact, as has been pointed out by Wallace and others, that the most
lovely and satisfying, the most sociable of all flowers, are those of temperate climates.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After having spent some time on the north-west coast of Borneo, varied by collecting
expeditions further in the interior of the Murut and Dusun countries, I took a passage
on the small trading steamer <i>Far East</i>, bound for Sandakan and the Sulu Archipelago. An intelligent young Scotchman, Mr.
W.&nbsp;C. Cowie, part owner and engineer, was on board, and enlivened the voyage with
a fund of information relating to the habits, customs, and trade of the natives among
whom we were going. We were accompanied by his brother, who was going to reside in
Sulu for trading purposes, and several Chinese and Malay traders also had taken deck
passages. We sailed about 7 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> on April 5th, and the weather being fine we obtained capital views of the Bornean
coast as we steamed along.
</p>
<p>This was the greatest season of drought which had been known here for some time, nearly
five months without rain, and this under a tropical sun, and in several places we
could see jungle fires raging along the coast. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184">184</a>]</span>The monsoon was dead against us, and we met numerous native boats flying down to Labuan
before the wind. These were laden with pearl-shell, trepang, etc., and were mostly
from the islands of Balabac and Palawan; some, however, had come round from the north-east
coast of Borneo, and even from the Sulu isles. In about a fortnight the monsoon is
expected to change, when they will find no difficulty in returning safely. At sunset,
and again at sunrise, we saw &#x201c;Kina Balu&#x201d; towering up into the clouds, and apparently
very near to the coast, but the distance is very deceptive. It was dark when we entered
Sandakan Bay, and about three o&#x2019;clock on the morning of the 8th, I was awakened by
the rattling of the anchor-chains, and found we were at Sandakan itself. It is merely
a small trading station consisting of about a dozen &#x201c;ataps,&#x201d; or palm thatched houses
built over the water, and a long &#x201c;jimbatan,&#x201d; or jetty, also on piles, serves as a
roadway and a landing stage for produce.
</p>
<p>At the time of my visit the only European residents were Mr. W.&nbsp;B. Pryer, who acted
as agent and resident for the company, who had just obtained cessions of territory
from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu respectively, and Mr. Martin, a trader. There
was formerly a depôt here belonging to the &#x201c;Labuan Trading Company,&#x201d; managed by a
Mr. Sachze, who died rather suddenly, as is believed by poison administered by his
wife, a beautiful native woman given to intrigue. We landed at daybreak, and Mr. Cowie
and myself took our guns and went for a walk in the forest behind the little group
of houses. We followed a path which had been recently cut, and which led us in a northerly
direction for about half a mile until we came to a stream descending the steep <span class="corr" id="xd29e2288" title="Source: hill side">hill-side</span> in a series of little falls. Pigeons were plentiful here, but the trees were too
high to allow of our shooting them. We also <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185">185</a>]</span>disturbed a colony of large red monkeys, who were breakfasting on a tall fig-tree
in fruit. We clambered up the hill-side and walked along the ridge for some distance.
The surface vegetation was very meagre, only a few ferns being obtained, all of which
I had seen before, with the exception of a bipinnate form of <i lang="la">Blechnum orientalis</i>, having fronds five feet in length.
</p>
<p>We retraced our steps along the ridge and descended near the houses, following for
some distance the little stream which supplies beautifully clear and cool water to
the houses, and ships which call in here occasionally. This stream falls over the
sandstone rocks about a hundred yards from the houses, to which it is conveyed by
a large bamboo aqueduct. Quite near to the rocks a neat little bath house has been
erected, and through the upper part of this structure the bamboo water-pipe is carried,
and by blocking it up with a plug a delicious shower-bath is obtainable. We sent for
our towels and clean clothes from the ship, and enjoyed our morning ablutions very
much. The noble <i lang="la">Dipteris Horsfieldii</i> was luxuriant on the rocks here, and a fine scarlet ixora was a perfect mass of bloom.
While searching for plants on the wet rocks near the bath-house, I was startled by
a snake popping its head out of a bunch of herbage just level with my face! I struck
at it with a stick I had in my hand, but it made its escape apparently unhurt, and
perhaps more frightened than I was, although I entertain a horror of these creatures.
Returning to the ship I shot a fine fish hawk as it flew overhead on its way to the
forest. After breakfast we paid Mr. Pryer a visit, and enjoyed looking over splendid
collections of Lepidoptera and Coleoptera which he had made here. Some of the butterflies
and beetles were especially fine, and several were supposed to be new to science.
He had also a small collection of bird skins <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186">186</a>]</span>made here, but I noted nothing among them different to those of the north-west coast.
</p>
<p>When Mr. Pryer first came to live here the natives had annoyed him a good deal by
coming below the house at night and stealing rice. This they did by making a hole
through the bags with a spear, so that the rice ran through the interstices of the
lath floor, and was caught in a vessel held below for that purpose. One day, however,
a tolerably large and healthy alligator was brought in for sale, and with the eye
of a naturalist, Mr. Pryer at once saw his chance. The ugly creature was purchased
and confined beneath the house, and it is needless to add that the nocturnal pilfering
in that direction was immediately discontinued. Alligators of enormous dimensions
are said to be very common here, but we had to be satisfied with a glimpse of a shark
in the bay. Elephants are said to come down to the banks of the Sagaliad river, and
a young rhinoceros was actually shot there a few months only after the time of our
visit. Having borrowed a boat and obtained a native crew we landed on two of the islands
in the bay, and found them equally barren. The only plants of interest we noticed
were one or two species of palms, which I had not seen elsewhere, and of one of these
I obtained a large quantity of seeds. We saw plenty of curlew, and large flocks of
milk white cranes or &#x201c;padi birds,&#x201d; rested on the trees near the shore. It was nearly
dusk when we returned to the ship, and being wet and dirty, as one almost invariably
is on exploring tours in the forest and jungle, we were glad to visit the little bath-house
once more, and change our clothes before dinner on the cool upper deck of the little
steamer.
</p>
<p>At daybreak I was awoke by the rattling of the chains as the anchor was weighed, and
in a few minutes afterwards Sandakan was behind us as we steamed away to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>the Sulu Archipelago. We reached Meimbong on the evening of the 10th, and anchored
just off the traders&#x2019; houses, which, as is usual here, are built on piles far enough
out from the shore for vessels to anchor at the little jetty before the doors. Sulu
is about thirty-six hours steaming from Sandakan, but in this case we were longer.
We reached the islands at the entrance to the harbour of Meimbong just at sundown,
and were much impressed by the indications of cultivation and fertility which they
presented. We could also see the cultivated patches and the fruit groves on the Sulu
hills quite plainly, while the cool fresh evening air was deliciously perfumed, with
what we afterwards found to be a mint-like plant (<i lang="la">Hyptis suaveolens</i>), very common throughout the island, especially in waste places and cornfields.
</p>
<p>After dinner we went ashore to see an old Chinaman named &#x201c;Peah,&#x201d; one of the principal
traders in the place. His house was half house and half warehouse, consisting of a
large front room the entire length of the house with some private apartments behind,
the kitchen, as is usual, being a separate structure at the end of the dwelling. Half
the large front room consisted of a raised platform about four feet in height, carpeted
with finely-worked pandan mats, and covered with a fancy chintz canopy, fringed in
front. Cushions were piled up on the parti-coloured mats, and between these and the
partition behind fancy coloured boxes were piled ostentatiously, each secured by a
brass lock of Chinese manufacture. On entering we found &#x201c;Peah&#x201d; sitting on the platform
talking to some Sulu traders, his wife, a neat little Chinese woman, and about a dozen
slaves and attendants, mostly Sulu girls. The room was but dimly illuminated with
<span class="corr" id="xd29e2313" title="Source: cocoa nut">cocoa-nut</span> oil lamps, but a couple of composite candles <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>were brought on our arrival, and installed in two fancy glass holders. The girls ran
away to the kitchen to prepare chocolate, which, together with biscuits, was soon
handed round, after which one of the dusky belles brought us nipa leaf cigarettes
very deftly made.
</p>
<p>A long &#x201c;bichara,&#x201d; or talk on trading and other topics now took place, gin and water
being handed round at intervals. We afterwards had some music on a kind of harmonica,
formed of about a dozen small gongs of graded sizes, arranged in a bamboo frame, these
being beaten dulcimer-like by two sticks to an accompaniment of five or six larger
gongs and of some Malay drums. The whole made a deafening noise as I thought, but
at a distance some very pleasant effects are produced, the smaller gongs sounding
quite sweet and bell-like in tone.
</p>
<p>It is not an uncommon practice for Sulu parents to sell their children, or for them
to be taken into slavery, as payment for some debt previously contracted by their
parents or guardians. It is a kind of slavery, however, like that in Borneo, which
is not so objectionable as it sounds, since they enjoy pretty much liberty, and are
often far better off in the way of food and clothing than if they were free; nor are
they torn from their home and friends as in the case of the poor African of years
ago. As I have said they are well treated and are rarely chastised, but we had one
instance of this being done during the time we lay in harbour here. A well-known Chinese
trader from Labuan &#x201c;Cheng Ting&#x201d; had brought with him a young Chinese servant, or &#x201c;boy&#x201d;
about twenty years of age, and for a Chinaman remarkably handsome, with a jet black
pig-tail hanging nearly as low as his heels. This &#x201c;boy&#x201d; was a great favourite with
&#x201c;Peah&#x2019;s&#x201d; Sulu girls, especially with one whom we, not knowing by name, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189">189</a>]</span>had christened the &#x201c;gipsy,&#x201d; a remarkably well made girl with expressive eyes, high
cheek-bones, and luxuriant hair, all of which was, doubtless, altogether too much
for the tender susceptibilities of a young oriental. We lay close <span class="corr" id="xd29e2324" title="Source: along side">alongside</span> the pile wharf, and one night were awoke by a woman&#x2019;s piercing shrieks, and the loud
voices of several men, and on our going to see the cause we found the youthful oriental
in the hands of a couple of &#x201c;Peah&#x2019;s&#x201d; coolies, who stripped this celestial Adonis,
and tying him to a post by his queue, they gave him a dozen or so with a rattan, at
which he did bawl most lustily, much to the amusement of his captors. And she, the
dusky Venus, was handed over to Mrs. &#x201c;Peah,&#x201d; who corrected her privately in the women&#x2019;s
apartment, and afterwards chained the erring damsel in a space below her own bed,
so as to prevent her stealing out to midnight meetings again during our stay. I do
not think either of the culprits were hurt much, and despite the yells of the &#x201c;boy,&#x201d;
the rascal was jolly enough and full of bravado when he came on board in the morning.
</p>
<p>The first morning after our arrival I and Mr. Cowie took a boat at sunrise and pulled
down to the market place. Leaving our boat at the Orang Kayu&#x2019;s house we walked through
the narrow gateway, and crossing the place where the market is held, just outside
the barricade, we followed the course of the river for some distance, and obtained
capital shooting at the large blue pigeons, evidently the same species as that so
common in Borneo. We should have had much better sport, only that about a dozen of
the &#x201c;lads of the village&#x201d; followed like curs at our heels, and they ran riot as soon
as ever they saw a bird fall, and in their eagerness to clutch it they did a good
deal of damage to a long-tailed rufous brown pigeon which I shot here for the first
time and wished <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190">190</a>]</span>to preserve. Their frantic leaping, splashing and yelling in the little stream and
on its banks also frightened away many birds before we could get within range, while
anything like remonstrance was so much labour thrown away. White and green paroquets
flew screaming overhead as they left the tall trees near the coast, where they had
evidently roosted for the night, and were now most probably on their way to their
feeding grounds, the fruit trees in the forest further inland. We crossed several
cultivated patches, and growing in clumps near the native houses we saw quantities
of <i lang="la">Musa textilis</i> cultivated here, and also in the Philippines, the fibre being used for cordage, and
it is also largely imported into this country under the name of &#x201c;manilla hemp.&#x201d; On
waste places beside the river, <i lang="la">Quisqualis indica</i> was very abundant, forming bushes about four feet in height, its slender branches
being literally borne down to the ground by the weight of its flowers, which hung
in immense clusters from the points of its branches.
</p>
<p>On our return we made a detour to the right and came upon several graves, a few of
which were fenced in with bushes and had rude headstones, or a post to mark the spot.
Other graves were neglected and overgrown with weeds. Here a variety of the &#x201c;Frangipane&#x201d;
(<i lang="la">Plumieria acuminata</i>), was very lovely, bearing immense clusters of its waxy flowers which exhale a most
delicious odour. These flowers are white with a yellow centre, and are flushed with
purple behind. This plant, or, as seen here in Sulu, small tree, is common throughout
the Malay region, and is by the natives esteemed as a suitable decoration for the
graves of their friends. Its Malay name of &#x201c;Bunga orang sudah mati,&#x201d; meaning literally,
&#x201c;Dead man&#x2019;s flower.&#x201d; We returned to the river near the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191">191</a>]</span>market-place and obtained a nice cool bath previous to returning for breakfast on
board. About two o&#x2019;clock we all returned, and leaving the boat in a creek a little
beyond the headman&#x2019;s house, we bore across the plain to the right through an orchard-like
grove of teak-trees. I had stopped to load my gun before starting, and when I hastened
on to rejoin my friends, I found them at the foot of a dead teak-tree, where they
had kindly awaited my coming to point out a pretty pink-flowered orchid which was
clinging to the naked branches right in the blazing sunshine, and flowering most profusely.
</p>
<p>We at last came to an undulating plain of coarse &#x201c;lallang&#x201d; grass four feet in height,
while the soil at our feet was thickly paved with vitrified slag or scoriæ, the product
of the island during its volcanic epoch. It was very hot, and the walking over the
sharp stones, hidden as they were in the tall grass, was, to say the least of it,
very troublesome. We had expected to find deer or wild pig in the patches of thick
jungle which occur here and there, but the dogs were too wild and did not hunt the
ground well. Along the edge of a bit of old forest we obtained an occasional shot
at a bird or two, and amongst others we secured a golden oriole with black wing, tips
and tail, a small hawk, and a large greenish paroquet, together with several pigeons.
The black and white and large blue pigeons were extremely plentiful here, as also
were white paroquets, but these last were too wary to allow us within range.
</p>
<p>I made several dips into the patches of old forest in search of plants, but nothing
of interest was seen. Orchids appeared to be very rare, and with the exception of
a dingy yellow-flowered cleisostoma which grew rather plentifully on the <span class="corr" id="xd29e2347" title="Source: teak trees">teak-trees</span>, nothing more was seen. We had had a long and wearying walk, and it was about <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192">192</a>]</span>half-an-hour before sundown when we returned to the boat and pulled to the ship for
dinner. I was very tired, but altogether pleased at having secured at least one new
species of orchid as well as two or three birds that I had never seen before. After
dinner I occupied myself in sketching my new pink orchid and in helping my &#x201c;boy&#x201d; skin
the birds I wished to preserve.
</p>
<p>I was happy in the labour, and no description could possibly convey any idea of that
delight which fills one when new and beautiful objects of natural history are discovered
for the first time.

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Soon after dinner one of the Sultan&#x2019;s &#x201c;ministers&#x201d; came on board to tell us that a
grand pig-hunt was to be held on the morrow, at which the Sultan and suite were to
be present, and as royal boar-hunts are not every-day affairs, we all made up our
minds to get ponies and go to see the sport. These pig-hunting forays are as popular
in Sulu as a royal stag-hunt at home, only that the Sulus have perhaps a better reason
to hunt their wild pigs, since they do a deal of damage to the growing crops. About
9 o&#x2019;clock in the morning we went down to the headman&#x2019;s house at Meimbong and got our
ponies saddled, and after a ride of about half-an-hour through long grass and bushes
we came upon the beaters and dogs in a strip of low jungle at the foot of a little
hill. The men were yelling and shouting so as to frighten the pigs from their covert
out into the grassy plain, where horsemen, each armed with a long slender-shafted
hunting-spear, were waiting in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194">194</a>]</span>readiness to give chase and dispatch them. We, too, waited here a little while, but
finding no signs of sport we rode on to a clump of low trees on the <span class="corr" id="xd29e2365" title="Source: hill side">hill-side</span> where we were told the Sultan and his people were waiting. We found His Highness
had dismounted, and was sitting on the trunk of a fallen tree, smoking and watching
for signs of sport. He looked pleased to see us, and after he had shaken hands with
Mr. Cowie, whom he had long known, I was introduced to him. Mr. Cowie told him I had
come to explore the island for natural history purposes, and that I particularly wished
to ascend the two highest mountains. He seemed rather amused to hear of a traveller
looking for flowers and birds, but graciously replied that I could go where I liked
and he would tell his people to help me, adding, that the best way of reaching the
highest mountain would be to come to his Istana and sleep there, after which the mountain
could be ascended in a day from that place. I had previously been recommended to his
good offices by the government at Labuan through their consular agent, Inche Mahomed,
of Brunei, who had landed here in Sulu a day or two previously in H.M. gunboat &#x201c;Fly,&#x201d;
Capt. McNeil. As I saw His Highness here seated on a fallen tree I could not help
noticing how emblematical the position was, since at the best his position here as
Sultan is but nominal, so fallen are the fortunes of his house. Only two months after
my visit, <i>i.e.</i>, in July, 1878, the Spaniards, after nibbling like timid mice at the Sulu cheese
for centuries took formal possession of the whole island by hoisting their flag in
the Sultan&#x2019;s capital of Meimbong.
</p>
<p>Behind him the Sultana and the ladies of her Court were mounted on ponies, one or
two scarlet and gold coloured umbrellas being held over them. Altogether there were
ten or twelve mounted ladies and several <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195">195</a>]</span>female attendants, betel-box carriers, &amp;c., on foot. The Sultan himself had forty
or fifty followers standing around in a broken circle. He is about thirty-five years
of age, and has a bright and intelligent countenance. His dress consisted of an embroidered
silk kerchief tied turban fashion on his head, a dark close-fitting jacket of semi-transparent
material, embroidered with red and yellow flowers, and having tight sleeves. Under
this he wore a white merino vest. Like most of his followers he wore breeches which
fit very tight below the knee, and are wide and baggy in the seat. These were black
and beautifully embroidered with flowers just below the knee. White socks and elastic-sided
boots of European manufacture completed what my sailor friends called &#x201c;his queer rig.&#x201d;
His eldest son, an &#x201c;awful young sweep,&#x201d; of about twenty years of age, was much more
gaily attired in a white striped blue vest and trowsers, and a bright buff head-dress,
while, like his father, he wore the short heavy Sulu sword or &#x201c;barong.&#x201d; The Sultana
and her suite kept in the background, of course, but were evidently much interested
at our visit. I noted that she wore full Turkish trowsers of blue silk richly embroidered,
and a blue vest fitting very tight and ornamented with gold buttons, lace in front,
using the universal sarong as a covering for her shoulders; around her head a clear
buff kerchief was tied turban fashion; white cotton stockings and a pair of Chinese
slippers completed her outward visibilities. Nearly all the Sulu women wear a deal
of yellow, which contrasts vividly with their luxuriant black hair, and like the men
they ride well and also in the same style,&#x2014;exactly, fair reader,&#x2014;<i lang="fr">à la fourchette</i>!
</p>
<p>We also had dismounted, of course, and had stood talking and looking on the particoloured
scene and swarthy faces around us, when suddenly a cry from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>jungle below, a regular chorus of men and dogs, told us that the bristly boar had
at last been driven into the open grass to run for his life. Everybody, Sultan and
all, scrambled to their ponies and away we all went, a gay cavalcade truly, down the
hill-side. Presently the pig came in sight, followed by one or two miserable-looking
curs and half-a-dozen men and boys on horseback, each armed with the long light-shafted
spear. We now saw of what sterling metal the Sulu ponies are made. On they came with
dilated nostrils and widely-spread forefeet, scarcely requiring a touch of the reins
to guide them as they avoided a jutting rock here or a half-hidden &#x201c;snag&#x201d; there, and
all the time turned and wheeled as quickly as the hunted pig itself. No European horse
would have kept its legs ten minutes on this uneven ground, paved as it was with immense
blocks of volcanic scoriæ. These intelligent little beasts seemed actually to understand
and enjoy the sport. One young fellow, mounted on a shapely little grey, at length
came up alongside the pig. Throwing his hempen bridle on the pony&#x2019;s neck, and deftly
handling his long spear, he wounded the boar in the side, at which it turned and rushed
at the horse, its long white curved tusks gleaming beside its open jaws. Quick as
thought the pony avoided him, and ere the pig could stay its impetuous rush the rider&#x2019;s
spear was struck right through its body at a thrust, the gleaming blade having entered
the soil to a depth of several inches. It was killed on the spot. The rider unfastened
a length of slender manilla rope from his saddle and threw it to a man on foot, who
slipped a noose over the body of the pig and afterwards tied the other end of the
rope to the horse&#x2019;s tail, and thus it was dragged away to the heap of slain porkers
some distance off. Seeing a couple of horsemen galloping in another direction we concluded
they had a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197">197</a>]</span>pig in chase, and so it proved. We headed the game and they soon came up to it, and
a thrust or two with the deadly spear and all was over with poor piggie. This was
a small black fellow about half the size of an English boar. Not entertaining the
prejudices of our Mahomedan friends we begged the body of this last pig, and when
the captors asked for what purpose we required it, we discreetly replied that we wanted
it for our dogs. This was satisfactory, and one of the men volunteered to drag it
down to the boat at his pony&#x2019;s tail.
</p>
<p>I shall not forget the Royal Pig Hunt in Sulu for some time. There we were among the
tall grass and jungle, and the ever changing position of the numerous gaily attired
horsemen was a beautiful sight to see. A group of fox-hunters at home by a covert
side is a pleasing sight, but here in the region of perpetual sunshine and palm-leaves&#x2014;in
this &#x201c;beautiful isle of the sea&#x201d;&#x2014;the sight was not only pleasing but quite a novelty
to us&#x2014;a thing seen for the first time, and perchance an experience never to be enjoyed
again. Down below us we could see long files of horsemen wending their way to another
piece of covert which the men on foot and dogs were now beating, while, on the little
rounded hill above, the Sultana and her ladies formed a bright and picturesque group
on horseback, their large vividly-coloured umbrellas standing out clear and sharp
against the cloudless sky.
</p>
<p>We saw the Sultan again towards the close of the day, and had a further chat with
him, in which he much regretted that the English would not help him to resist the
<span class="corr" id="xd29e2386" title="Source: agressions">aggressions</span> of his neighbours, the Spaniards, whom the Sultan detests, and perhaps not without
reason. He sent a man to see how many pigs had been killed, and on being told seventeen,
he observed, that they had sometimes killed as many as fifty in one day&#x2019;s hunting.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198">198</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thanking him for his invitation to us to visit him at the Istana, which he had again
repeated, we bade <span class="corr" id="xd29e2392" title="Source: him him">him</span> adieu, and returned towards Meimbong, well pleased with our day&#x2019;s adventures. The
Sultan and his suite rode towards the Istana, but his son, before alluded to, accompanied
us with a <i>posse</i> of his young followers. When we reached the arable plain near the market-place, we
came upon another group of hunters, and nothing would please the young rascal but
that I and Mr. Cowie should try some of his father&#x2019;s horses. They are beautiful creatures
of the Sulu breed, but with a little of the Arab blood added. They are never shod,
and in picking their way among rocks or fallen trunks of trees they are as sure-footed
as a goat. We had some capital racing. The Sulu saddles are of wood, very small, with
high wooden pommels, resembling those of a cavalry saddle. The stirrups are represented
by a woven hemp riband four feet long and about an inch wide, with a loop at each
end, through which the big toe of the rider is inserted. This riband passes through
an opening over the top of the saddle, and is not fixed, but slides backwards and
forwards according to the pressure brought to bear on it by the rider. Of course,
I could not ride on one of these little saddles with sliding stirrups, so I had them
taken off and returned to my boyish practice of bare-backed riding. These ponies had
been out hunting all day and yet showed no traces of fatigue, indeed they flew over
the dry clods at full speed and evidently were quite used to racing&#x2014;appearing to enjoy
it as much as we did ourselves.
</p>
<p>After this sport was concluded we returned on board to dinner, after having stopped
for a few minutes at the ford near the market to get a bath in the stream, which is
here as clear and sparkling as a Derbyshire brook. This <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199">199</a>]</span>day&#x2019;s public amusement taking place as it did so soon after my arrival was a most
fortunate thing for me, since I thus obtained an introduction to the Sultan and most
of his people, and wherever I wandered in the island afterwards I was always well
received, which was lucky, since the Sulus are not noted for their civility to strangers.
Even the small cotters who cultivate their little farms and fruit groves up on the
hills had heard of me, and were very hospitable when, as happened soon afterwards,
I found my way up amongst them. The Sulu hills are especially beautiful.
</p>
<p>Nearly every day, morning and evening, we used to go down to the little Meimbong river
near the Orang Kayu&#x2019;s house to bathe; and in the evening especially the tops of the
highest hills were lovely, glowing with warmth in the golden light; now clear, now
hazy, the last tremulous kisses of the lingering sun. I used to walk a mile or two
up the left bank of the winding river nearly every evening before I had my bath, and
I nearly always took my gun, as the birds here were tolerably plentiful, and in some
cases very beautiful or interesting. There are at least a dozen kinds of pigeons and
doves; and three of the species I shot, I had never seen before. Paroquets are common,
and fly shrieking overhead morning and evening. I shot four kinds in all, two large
green ones, a white one, and a small green one having a blue head, and a pair of long-shafted,
racquet-shaped feathers in its tail.
</p>
<p>One of the most conspicuous of the birds here is the gold and black oriole before
mentioned, and a blackbird having a grey back and immense flesh-coloured orbits is
not uncommon on trees beside the river. Two species of kingfisher were seen; one the
common blue kind, with a white ring around its neck, and a discordant, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200">200</a>]</span>laughing note: white padi birds, curlew, sandpipers, and a crow, are also quite common;
eagles, ospreys, and hawks also abound; and I especially noticed an eagle or harrier
circling over the grassy plains, regularly hunting the ground, and occasionally stooping
as if to secure its prey. This bird is pure white, with black wing tips and tail.
A water-rail was seen beside the river near the town, and night-flying birds of the
owl tribe were also observed; but the familiar &#x201c;chuck-chuck&#x201d; note of the &#x201c;night-jar,&#x201d;
so common on moonlight nights in Labuan, we never once heard here. I saw one large
owl dead, and much regret that I did not skin and preserve it, badly as the thing
was mutilated. It resembled our native &#x201c;barn owl&#x201d; in general appearance and colour,
but was much larger, the spread of its soft fledged wings being over four feet. I
saw one species of hornbill on the hills and a pheasant, which, from the momentary
glimpse I caught of it, I took to belong to the &#x201c;fireback&#x201d; species, so common in some
parts of Borneo.
</p>
<p>Deer are said to be plentiful; but we did not catch a glimpse of them, although when
riding in the interior I have often disturbed the wild pigs among the long-matted
grass near the river. An enormous species of day-flying bat was quite common here
near the Sultan&#x2019;s palace, and most weird and supernatural did they appear on dull
days, solemnly flying from one tree to another, their great wings distended against
the leaden sky overhead. As far as I could see they were feeding on the durian trees
which surround the Istana, and probably sipping the nectar from the large white flowers.
I shot one which measured four feet six inches across its outspread wings, and its
head was as large as that of a little terrier dog, and of a similar shape, being of
a dark foxey brown colour. Its eyes were of a sickly pale brown tint, with a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201">201</a>]</span>small black pupil, and its entire body in the warm limpness of death exhaled such
a repulsive musky odour, far worse than any downright stink I ever experienced, and
so penetrating and adhesive, that my hands smelt of it for days, in spite of carbolic
soap and repeated washings. I had no means of ascertaining whether this is really
a distinct species, or whether it is conspecific with the large nocturnal fruit-bat
of Borneo, immense flocks of which may be seen passing overhead at dusk to their feeding-grounds,
the fruit orchards.
</p>
<p>Of all the smaller forms of animal life in temperate countries the butterflies are
the most absolutely beautiful. In the tropics they are especially so, being there
found of the largest size and most lovely hues. In the rice fields and by the open
pathways, lively little golden-winged kinds flutter in the sunshine. Some are quite
wholly golden, others amber, with black fringes to their wings; many varieties enliven
the river margins, and others sail aloft around the tops of the great forest trees.
The nearly dry bed of a forest stream is an attractive spot to many of the finest
tropical butterflies, especially if it be chequered with shade and sunshine. In such
a place they may be seen by the hundred, flitting, fluttering, skimming or wobbling
to and fro, enlivening the cool greenery with their colour, beauty, and variety of
motion. Here you see them at home and happy. Their colours defy description, so variable
do they appear as seen in the sunlight; sulphur and black, amber and blue, velvety
bands, purple shot with bronze, wings of blue, inclining to green, and of green inclining
to blue, and of velvety blackness banded with pea or apple-green, are only a few of
their combinations. Their beauty of presence is so satisfying, that we almost forget
their life history, the egg so dainty in form, and often so beautiful <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202">202</a>]</span>in sculpture, the caterpillar, attractive in its way, and chiefly remarkable for its
leaf-eating powers; then the long sleep in a silken hammock, and finally a sunny awakening
into life and beauty as a daintily painted butterfly. There must be something in the
climate or vegetation of the Sulu islands especially favourable to insect life, and
nowhere else did I see butterflies so plentiful as here, not only in the forest and
by the river, but around the houses of Meimbong itself.
</p>
<p>The site of the market being littered with fragments of fruit and other <i>débris</i>, was especially attractive to them; on being disturbed they fluttered away in crowds,
only to return almost immediately to feast on the wasted sweets, and to open and close
their gorgeous wings in the sunshine.
</p>
<p>We were fortunate in obtaining plenty of fresh fish while lying in harbour here, and
there were many kinds, some being strikingly beautiful in colour. Herrings and mackerel&#x2014;or
fish which so closely resemble them in size, colour, and flavour, that we did not
distinguish the difference, were often brought on board. A singular white &#x201c;ink fish,&#x201d;
having large dark eyes and long tentacles, is eaten both by natives and Chinese. A
large fish of a vermilion colour, in shape like a large carp, is plentiful and nice
eating, as also is a similarly shaped species of an ashy grey colour, its sides delicately
banded with blue and yellow. In the river are freshwater fish a couple of pounds or
more in weight, and good angling is obtainable. Captain McNeil caught a nice basketful
or two with rod and line by whipping down stream in the true Devonshire style. One
of the fish he captured would weigh nearly two pounds, and had a sharp spined dorsal
fin like an English perch. Mr. Cowie maintains that he has seen real spotted trout
taken out <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203">203</a>]</span>of this water; but I think some other kind must be meant, although the water is quite
pure enough for that gentlemanly little fish.
</p>
<p>From what I have written it will be seen that although Sulu cannot now afford elephant
or tiger hunting like Malacca, India, or Ceylon, there is plenty of sport obtainable
here nevertheless; indeed there are few countries eastward where better hunting, shooting,
and rod-fishing can be obtained. Sulu as seen from a distance on board a ship out
at sea, appears to be nearly all under cultivation; but on riding into the interior
a good deal of uncultivated land and jungle is seen. The jungle portion has mostly
been under cultivation in former years, and is now lying fallow previous to its vegetation
being again cleared off by fire ready for the rude plough-culture here adopted. As
approached from the westward the island is really very picturesque, two or three of
its peaks rising from two to three thousand feet above sea level; these are separated
from the coast by gentle undulating hills or flattish plains. One or two of the high
hills are quite denuded of the old forest, and cultivation extends to their summits.
The two highest peaks, however, are still clothed with the forest <span class="corr" id="xd29e2425" title="Source: primeval">primæval</span>, and it was these two that I so much wished to explore. The highest is Bu&#x2019;at Timantangis,
or &#x201c;Hill of Tears.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>I was curious to know why such a poetic title had been applied to the highest of the
Sulu peaks, and so I made inquiries. In all cases the natives agreed as to the &#x201c;reason
why,&#x201d; which is this. When the Sulu boats sail away towards the horizon on their trading
excursions, this peak is the last bit of their native land which is visible; it is
the &#x201c;white cliffs of old England&#x201d; to them; and the wanderers being accustomed to remember
their peaceful sunlit homes and their friends, drop a tear as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204">204</a>]</span>the last glimpse of their native earth fades from sight, perhaps for months, or even
years; hence the name Bu&#x2019;at Timantangis, or the &#x201c;Hill of Tears.&#x201d; Bu&#x2019;at Dahau is, however,
but little less in altitude; and it is doubtless at its apex that the last crater
in the island existed, although of course it has long been extinct; yet the course
of the <i>débris</i> thrown out can be seen down its sides, which are scarred or furrowed by volcanic
action in a very marked manner. Sugh, the ancient capital,&#x2014;or Banawa as the place
is now called&#x2014;is in the hands of the Spaniards, and pretty regular communication is
kept up from thence to Manilla and the Philippine group. One of the Chinese traders
who came with us visited the place and brought back several jars of excellent biscuits
and a few boxes of fine Manilla cigars. There are two <span class="corr" id="xd29e2434" title="Source: market places">market-places</span> in Meimbong, and there are three markets during the week; and as very few places
afford a better epitome of the thrift of a people or the produce of a country than
a market, I will briefly allude to what I saw of these held here.
</p>
<p>We went to bathe early one morning, and saw the market-people coming in from all directions
and bringing produce of the most varied character. Most of them&#x2014;both men and women&#x2014;were
mounted on ponies or buffaloes; some indeed ride their cows to market as being preferable
to walking, their produce being slung across the saddle before or behind. Every man
carried a spear, and a couple of hours later the space beneath the clumps of bamboo
just to the left of the market gate, was crowded with people, the women trading, and
the men standing talking in groups, all the business of the day being done amid a
forest of spears. The country people from the hills were very much interested in us
as we moved about amongst them and their goods. Sweet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205">205</a>]</span>potatoes, mangoes, bananas, yams and corn cobs, were offered for sale in neatly woven
baskets made of cocoa-nut leaves. The leaves of piper betel made up into little packets,
and lime beautifully fine and white (made by burning coral limestone and shells) were
offered to betel-chewers; nor was a good supply of the <span class="corr" id="xd29e2441" title="Source: betel nuts">betel-nuts</span> themselves wanting. We especially noticed a very large fruited variety of <i lang="la">Areca catechu</i> here, which I had never before seen, the individual fruits being as large as a hen&#x2019;s
egg, and of a clear bright yellow colour. The typical form so common in Singapore
and Labuan, has fruits the size of a pigeon&#x2019;s egg only, and of a clear orange-red
colour.
</p>
<p>Tobacco leaves of native growth and manufacture were exposed for sale in bundles,
and some of it is made up into balls as large as a man&#x2019;s head, and several pounds
in weight. Although tobacco can be easily grown here, it is but little valued, owing
to faulty preparation; and the inferior Chinese tobacco is preferred by the Sulus
to their own produce, and is a regular kind of currency in which almost all small
payments may be made. Thus, the hire of a pony for a day is about two bundles; a day&#x2019;s
wage for a man about the same. The wholesale price in Singapore is about sixpence
a bundle, or even less. At the time of our visit rice was very scarce and dear in
Sulu; indeed as much as ten dollars per picul was paid, while horses and cattle were
relatively very cheap. Thus good buffaloes could be bought for eight or ten dollars
each; cattle at six to fifteen dollars a head, and ponies at ten to twenty dollars;
indeed many of the people were well nigh starving owing to the last war and the dry
season combined; and in many cases they were glad to sell their cattle for rice, or
the means of obtaining it. Among the few articles of native manufacture offered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206">206</a>]</span>for sale, I noticed embroidered kerchiefs and sarongs, also rope of good quality.
Fish, eggs, cocoa-nuts, jack-fruit, and cucumbers, were exceedingly plentiful.
</p>
<p>It is not uncommon to see some few of the Sulus from the hills wearing tunics of chain
armour, having brass plates on the breast and down the back, all the rest being fine
chain-work. At the time of our visit Mr. Cowie bought one of these tunics for about
two pounds, which he paid in rice. The Sulus themselves say that these were formerly
made in the island, but I think this is extremely doubtful; and it is far more probable
that this armour formerly belonged to their old enemies the Spaniards, from whom they
have obtained it during the numerous wars between them. The most singular thing is
that the comparatively few Sulus who possess these tunics should continue to wear
them, as they most assuredly do.
</p>
<p>There are a good few Chinese settlers here in Meimbong who have stalls on which to
expose their goods in the markets. They supply needles, thread, betel-nut knives,
cheap calico and print goods, handkerchiefs, and occasionally blades of the choppers
generally used in Sulu, and other common cutlery, looking-glasses, boxes, &amp;c. The
currency here is now the Chinese brass &#x201c;cash,&#x201d; the rate of exchange at the time of
my visit being 900 to the dollar. Payments of small amounts however, say up to twenty
dollars, can always be made in white or &#x201c;grey shirting.&#x201d; The packets of Chinese tobacco
before alluded to, serve for small change.

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One evening about sundown, immediately after an early dinner on board, we set off
to the Sultan&#x2019;s Istana, which is situated just at the foot of Bu&#x2019;at Timantangis, the
highest mountain in the island. The distance from the harbour at Meimbong is seven
or eight miles, a pleasant ride indeed across an undulating and tolerably well cultivated
plain. We had ordered our ponies to be in readiness at the Orang Kayu&#x2019;s house, and
the boatmen who accompanied us from the ship soon saddled them for us and made all
ready. Mr. Anson Cowie accompanied me. We had three ponies, two for ourselves, and
one for a Sulu lad who had charge of our stores, guns, &amp;c., and who came to attend
to the ponies and accompany us up the mountain, to ascend which was the main object
of our journey. All the little details <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208">208</a>]</span>requisite at starting attended to, it was nearly seven o&#x2019;clock as we rode through
the market gate, just opposite the headman&#x2019;s house&#x2014;a veritable needle&#x2019;s eye&#x2014;there
being barely room for a slim Sulu pony and its rider to squeeze through. The moon
was in the full, and rose as we started over the plain. We had a delightful gallop,
and had no need of a guide, as the horses knew the way perfectly well. It had been
a remarkably hot day, but it was now deliciously cool, the soft air being gratefully
redolent with the odour of a mint-like plant (<i lang="la">Hyptis</i>) before mentioned. We laughed and sang to our heart&#x2019;s content, and doubtless much
to the surprise of the few Sulus we met hurrying homewards.
</p>
<p>It seems strange that these beautiful and well cultivated islands should be still
the last great stronghold of piracy in the eastern seas. This has been the great blot
on the Sulu character for centuries; and they are also credited with having poisoned
many of the traders who formerly visited the island, and to whom they had become largely
indebted for goods. We reached the Istana soon after eight o&#x2019;clock, and tying our
ponies to the verandah we ascended to the audience-chamber above. Here, in this chamber,
we noticed two small Armstrong guns mounted on low carriages, and a Gatling gun or
mitrailleuse was also conspicuous. The presence of the modern armament here would
have been rather puzzling had we not known that the Sultan had obtained these guns
from the steam-ship <i>America</i>, as the first instalment of the rental or payment which has to be made annually to
the Sultan on account of his having ceded Sandakan and his territory in North Borneo
to Baron Overbeck&#x2019;s Company.
</p>
<p>Velvet-lined armchairs were immediately placed for us at a round table below the raised
platform, and refreshments <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209">209</a>]</span>consisting of excellent chocolate and sweet biscuits were brought in. The Sultan&#x2019;s
own servant or &#x201c;boy,&#x201d; &#x201c;Gelah,&#x201d; a most amusing fellow, saw that we were properly attended
to, and told us that His Highness would soon be in to welcome us. After the chocolate,
brandy and excellent Manilla cigars appeared under the direction of &#x201c;Gelah,&#x201d; who seemed
to know the habits of Englishmen tolerably well. He spoke Malay better than most of
the others, and this language formed the only means of communication we had. The attendants
not having brought a corkscrew, he sent off to fetch one, and then poured us out a
glass each. It was Three Star <span class="corr" id="xd29e2479" title="Source: Hennessey">Hennessy</span>, and very good. After helping us, the imp took up one of the chocolate cups, poured
a little water into it to rinse it, and then slung it out at the open door. He then
very coolly nearly filled the cup with brandy and tossed it off neat without wincing;
he also helped himself to the cigars as though to the manner born. As soon as we entered
several boys, superintended by an old woman, had brought in a lot of cushions and
arranged them on the platform near us. A lamp, and fancy betel and cigarette boxes
were next brought and arranged. The Sultan himself appeared on the platform soon after
we had finished eating, and shook hands with us very affably before he reclined on
the cushions which had been placed for him. He came in with a dignified step and reclined
very gracefully; but as conversation warmed up he sat upright on the edge of the platform
with his legs dangling down in front, apparently as free and easy as a schoolboy on
a rail fence. A good many Sulus came in during the evening, so that at ten o&#x2019;clock
the space between the platform and the door was pretty well filled. Some of his people
had evidently told him of my propensity for sketching, and he asked to see my sketch-book.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210">210</a>]</span>Amongst other things therein was a rough sketch of a &#x201c;barong&#x201d; or sword, and its carved
sheath belonging to the old Orang Kayu at Meimbong, which His Highness at once recognised,
and he sent off &#x201c;Gelah&#x201d; to fetch a valuable one of his own, which was, as he told
me, of Sulu manufacture. The blade was beautifully finished, having an inlaid representation
of a scorpion on one side and a centipede on the other, together with some Arabic
dates of important events. The handle was of ivory, carved and mounted in chased gold
and pearls. I made a sketch of this weapon, at which he was greatly pleased, and he
watched every line and touch with great interest.
</p>
<p>We had dined previous to our leaving the ship, and I had congratulated myself earlier
in the evening at having been lucky enough to escape eating more than a biscuit with
my cup of chocolate; but even after ten o&#x2019;clock our table was loaded with more edibles.
There were dishes of snowy rice, biscuits, excellent fish, curried fowl, eggs boiled,
and some bananas and other fruit. The whole was daintily cooked and well served. With
a graceful wave of the hand he requested us to satisfy the hunger which, as he said,
he felt sure had been occasioned by the long ride we had been so good as to undergo
in order to visit him. Of course there was nothing for it but to fall to; and I must
say that we both enjoyed the fresh fish and rice, and the well-made curry very much.
Clean water and glasses were placed on the table, and chocolate was again brought
in. After this meal more brandy and water and cigars were introduced to our notice
by &#x201c;Gelah,&#x201d; and we kept up a conversation with His Highness until after twelve o&#x2019;clock,
when he withdrew after having had a peep to see that our sleeping apartment was in
good order. As soon as his back was turned towards us&#x2014;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211">211</a>]</span>almost before, &#x201c;Gelah&#x201d; pocketed all the surplus cigars and took another cup of neat
brandy,&#x2014;his example being followed by one or two of the other attendants.
</p>
<p>We retired to our room for the night; and then the Sultan&#x2019;s son, Datu Mahomed, and
&#x201c;Bottelah,&#x201d; the Sultan&#x2019;s secretary, together with two or three others, including &#x201c;Gelah,&#x201d;
came in for a chat, so that we did not get a chance of sleeping a wink until after
two o&#x2019;clock. Even when we were alone in our sleeping apartment, and had reclined just
as we were in our clothes on the cushions and finely worked mats spread out for us,
I somehow felt conscious that we were watched; and once I caught a glimpse of a dark
figure gliding past a square opening in the wall above. Our room communicated with
the audience chamber which we had just left, by a window-like opening about two feet
square. The lights in the large chamber had been extinguished, while we, as is customary
in the East, had a glimmering oil lamp in our room, so that any one in the audience
chamber could see us plainly, without being themselves seen. We had no fear of treachery,
and yet could not help feeling a creeping sensation of uneasiness as shadow after
shadow passed the opening to the right of which we lay. At length a shadow lingering
longer than usual, I sprang to my feet and put my head through the opening. A little
suppressed scream, and the patter of bare feet on the platform on the other side,
followed by muffled titters and whispering, told the tale.
</p>
<p>The ladies of the court, debarred by etiquette from seeing us publicly, had taken
advantage of the darkness to obtain a peep at us. Barefooted, they had moved more
silently than mice on the platform in the next room, and had satisfied their curiosity
by stealing to the opening one after another, and looking down on us to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212">212</a>]</span>their hearts&#x2019; content. After this we got an hour or two of rest, and awoke at daybreak,
when everybody was astir. We found our breakfast ready, and our ponies were saddled
and at the door.
</p>
<p>The men whom the Sultan had promised us as guides, and a buffalo to carry down plants,
were also waiting, and &#x201c;Gelah&#x201d; was eager to accompany us by order of his royal master.
Breakfast over, we started off in excellent spirits up a gently rising path leading
past a burial ground, and beneath some of the finest Durian trees in the island. A
newly made grave ornamented with flowers and the young flower-stems of the betel-nut
palm, was pointed out to us as being that of a man who had been shot at the Istana
in a squabble about one of the ladies of the court. It appears that the man&#x2019;s wife
having died he wanted to carry off a relation of his who now belonged to the Sultana&#x2019;s
suite, and in the row which followed he met with his death.
</p>
<p>Our ride was a very pleasant one, and led us up through several cultivated patches
with here and there a belt of jungle. Soon after leaving the Istana an aerides was
seen flowering very freely on the trees, also the ubiquitous <i lang="la">Dendrobium crumenatum</i>, with pseudo bulbs four feet in length, the flowers much larger than usual. <i lang="la">Cymbidium aloifolium</i> was everywhere plentiful, clustering in large masses on the boles of large trees
in the clearings. At an elevation of about 1000 feet we came to a village and fruit
grove, and here we stayed to rest awhile as the sun was now very hot overhead, and
a drink of cocoa-nut milk proved very grateful. On the trees here I obtained a greenish
yellow flowered dendrobium, which proved to be a new species very similar to the <i lang="la">D. d&#x2019;Albertisii</i> of New Guinea. At about 1500 feet we reached the skirt of the old forest, and had
to dismount and do the rest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213">213</a>]</span>of the ascent on foot. We had brought ropes with us, and removing the saddles and
other gear we tethered the horses and buffalo to bushes in a little natural meadow
where they could make a good meal off the fresh mountain grass. This was a great treat
to them, as the coarse herbage of the plains was at this season very dry, and the
horses in Meimbong were being fed on cocoa-nut leaves owing to the dearth of other
fodder. We descended a gully, and crossing a little stream commenced the ascent on
foot, leaving a Sulu lad in charge of our goods and animals. We had at first a rough
climb over tree roots and loose stones. In one place the ascent was nearly vertical,
and the boulders being easily detached from the dry soil, it was dangerous for our
followers below. An areca palm bearing large clusters of small scarlet fruit below
a spreading crown of dark green leaves was very handsome, and both ferns and selaginellas
were luxuriant in the shade. I collected specimens of all I saw for scientific purposes.
Pigeons and paroquets and other birds were seen here on the trees overhead, but although
we shot at several and saw them fall, the branches overhead were so dense that they
lodged there, and we could not induce any of our followers to climb for them on account
of the deadly tree snakes, which are said to infest the place.
</p>
<p>Our guides did not like the ascent, and tried to make us believe that the point of
the ridge was the top of the mountain, but we insisted in pushing further up the ridge
and at length were rewarded by reaching the summit. The air was very fresh and cool
here, and by climbing a low-branched tree we obtained splendid views of the surrounding
plains and <span class="corr" id="xd29e2510" title="Source: hill tops">hill-tops</span> and of the sea. We rested here for some time. A strong-growing species of pentaphragma,
bearing pure white flowers in the axils of its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214">214</a>]</span>oblong fleshy leaves grew here plentifully, and an aucuba-like shrub bore clusters
of red berries as large as peas. Tree ferns also grew up to the top, and their stems
were draped with long green moss, which looked very fresh and pretty. Two or three
species of anæctochilus also grew here, their rich velvety leaves being illuminated
with gold and silvery veins. From one spot in the descent we could see the coast and
the outlying islets very plainly, also more newly-formed coral islets inlaid with
lagoons. We saw abundant evidence of wild pigs and deer up this mountain, but the
wild cattle which formerly existed plentifully are now quite extinct.
</p>
<p>During our conversation about this mountain last night the Sultan told us some wonderful
stories of birds&#x2019; nest caves, and of a cavity or hole at the top lined with mother
of pearl (tepoy) large enough for several men to bathe in at the same time, also of
the wild men who lived in the forest, making their habitations in the trees, and of
other wonderful things, all of which he discreetly added we should not be able to
see without we had supernatural assistance. The gods truly were unpropitious, for
we saw none of the mysteries of the mountain to which he had referred. Wild men may
formerly have inhabited the trees of the forest here, as the &#x201c;jakuns&#x201d; still do in
Jahore, and what he told us may have been a well-worn old tradition handed down for
many generations. It is not improbable that his reference to the crater at the top
was the remains of an old tradition of the volcanoes which once, without a doubt,
did exist here in the island.
</p>
<p>We descended to the village, leaving the men to bring on the horses and gear, and
here &#x201c;Gelah&#x201d; procured us some hot water, and we sat down under the shady trees and
enjoyed our lunch of chocolate and biscuit. &#x201c;Gelah&#x201d; told us he did not care for chocolate
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215">215</a>]</span>and asked for some brandy. I gave him half a tumblerful, which he drank and became
very communicative. He lighted one of the cigars he had appropriated last night&#x2014;indeed
he had been smoking them all the morning&#x2014;and then he told us that many of the Sulus
were bad men and great thieves, adding that he was a good man himself, and that was
why the Sultan liked him. He then helped himself to more brandy, tossing it off undiluted
as before. He then launched out into a long story of a pirate fleet having left Tawi-Tawi
about a year before, and remarked that they had but just returned with a good deal
of plunder. Wallace mentions<a class="noteref" id="xd29e2520src" href="#xd29e2520">1</a> that these Sulu pirates sometimes visit the Aru islands near New Guinea and Ceram
on their predatory expeditions. They only attack small trading prahus now, but in
former times even large sailing vessels were not safe from their attacks.
</p>
<p>We now mounted our ponies and retraced our steps to the Istana, which we reached at
dusk pretty well tired. We rested some time and gave the Sultan an account of our
ascent. He pressed us to remain all night, but this we did not care to do, and thanking
him for his hospitality and assistance, we mounted our ponies once more and rode back
to Meimbong in the moonlight. Arriving at the Orang Kayu&#x2019;s house we found the boat
there to meet us and take us on board, but it was then low water in the river, and
we had to wait some hours, so we went into the headman&#x2019;s house, and lying down, slept
until near midnight, when our men awoke us and rowed us up the river and across to
the ship. It is a common opinion, and in the main I believe a correct one, that the
Sulus are great thieves. I never lost anything among them, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216">216</a>]</span>and a small bag I left accidentally at the headman&#x2019;s house containing two or three
dollars, a knife, ammunition, and other trifles, was handed on board in the morning
untouched. From what I saw of Sulu and the inhabitants it appeared to me very evident
that civilisation had formerly been much higher than it is at present. This is especially
to be seen in their old buildings and manufactures. Thus the oldest of the dwellings
had beautifully carved woodwork over the windows and doors, and had been erected of
wood and with much more careful taste and labour than is now devoted to the same kind
of work.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p216width" id="p216"><img src="images/p216.jpg" alt="Carved woodwork over doors and windows." width="388" height="250"></div><p>
</p>
<p>Nowhere else in the East did I see more evidence of tasteful purpose in design than
here in Sulu. Here is a little sketch I made of a carved wood heading to the door
of the Sultan&#x2019;s Istana. Motive two conventional alligators holding a disc on which
is written a Malay inscription in Arabic characters, the whole surrounded by open
work. Some old knives were also most beautifully decorated, the blades being of splendid
finish, and the hilts and sheaths of hard wood, carved very artistically. In Brunei
city I had noted a few lattice windows in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217">217</a>]</span>older pile dwellings rather pretty in design, but not at all equal to the free and
vigorous carving of the Sulus.
</p>
<p>The older manufactures again, such as krisses, barongs, spear-heads, betel-boxes,
indeed metal work generally, and particularly the artistic element, were formerly
much finer than is now the case. The Sulus themselves, a well-built and originally
a brave race, have deteriorated, and after resisting the incursion of their old enemies,
the Spaniards, for generations, indeed centuries, are now utterly dispirited. Some
of their chiefs indeed have intrigued with their old foes, and the result is that
their country, and probably the last of her Sultans, is virtually under Spanish rule.
The Sultan himself is a bright and intelligent man, but given to opium smoking, and
some of his headmen and Datus composing the &#x201c;ruma bichara,&#x201d; a council chamber by which
the Sulu has long been governed, taking advantage of his ease-loving nature have beguiled
him with flattery, and advised him to sign one treaty after another until the entire
Sulu Archipelago may now be considered as virtually belonging to the Philippine government.
</p>
<p>As a race the Sulus are well developed, taller, and paler in colour than the Malays
generally. The women are often very pleasing, with luxuriant hair and bright expressive
eyes. Some of them, notably the wives and daughters of the chief men, are very pale,
white almost in comparison with the women of the island, who are more often exposed
to the effects of climate and labour. Several ladies of the court were pale in colour,
with regular Italian-like features, and one of the wives of Datu Haroun&#x2014;a sweet gentle
creature&#x2014;might readily have been mistaken for a European. She was essentially lady-like
in voice and manner, and deserved a far better fate than that of nominal wife, but
virtually slave of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218">218</a>]</span>crafty and cruel traitor to his country. Upon the women here, as throughout Borneo,
devolves a large share of the everyday labour, and nearly all the trading in the markets
is conducted by them, while their lords and masters stand listlessly by spear in hand,
or gather in little groups to talk. Everywhere we saw them at work making mats or
baskets, or met them in dug-out canoes and outriggers going to or coming from market,
or from the place where the fresh water is daily obtained, below the Orang Kayu&#x2019;s
house. The women of the better class spend much of their time in embroidery and in
cooking, indeed we were assured that the food set before us at the Istana had been
prepared under the Sultana&#x2019;s personal supervision, which I can well believe, and I
do not think English ladies could have prepared such a repast as it was in a better
way; indeed the snowy bowl of rice would, I think, prove inimitable to most of our
lady cooks at home. Riding is fashionable in Sulu, and none but the very poorest walk
far. Anything seems acceptable as a steed, and if the aristocratic grey pony with
somewhat of Arab fleetness and gentleness is not obtainable, buffaloes, and even the
cows, are taken as substitutes.
</p>
<p>It is really a very pretty sight to see the market people coming to market from the
hills, men and women alike, mounted on ponies or cattle with their baskets, bags,
and bundles of produce flung across the saddle before and behind. The men, especially,
mounted on their high wooden saddles, armed with the national spear, and clad in chain
armour tunic, forcibly reminded one of the illustrations of Don Quixote, a resemblance
considerably heightened by the gaunt leanness of their steeds. A plurality of wives
is general with the Datus, and others who have means to keep up an establishment,
and these women are for the most part purchased from their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219">219</a>]</span>parents, although formerly they were not unfrequently captured during piratical excursions.
St. John<a class="noteref" id="xd29e2544src" href="#xd29e2544">2</a> mentions an instance where a pirate chief from Tawi-Tawi captured a Spanish schooner
in 1859, and finding the captain&#x2019;s daughter on board, he made her his principal wife
and treated her with every attention; she subsequently bore him a child, the Spanish
authorities having failed in their attempts to recover her.
</p>
<p>As I have before intimated slavery is still common in Sulu, although there is no regular
great slave mart such as existed only a few years ago at Sugh, the former capital.
It is no uncommon occurrence for parents to sell their daughters, and visitors to
Sulu are solicited even now to purchase wives at prices varying from fifty to two
hundred dollars. I knew of one instance in which a trading captain presented his native
wife, a Sulu girl, to the captain of another steamer, and the officers of Dutch vessels
trading here in the Malay Archipelago nearly always keep native wives on board, and
as a rule I believe these women are kindly treated. Throughout Malasia woman&#x2019;s position
is unfortunately a very low one. If possessed of personal attractions she is directly
or indirectly sold to the highest bidder, and while her youthful charms last she may
be spared actual toil, while her less attractive sister labours daily in house or
field, but eventually a younger, fairer wife supplants her, and during her declining
years she is&#x2014;
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&#x201c;In daily labours of the loom employed,
</p>
<p class="line">Or doom&#x2019;d to deck the bed she once enjoyed.&#x201d;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">All this is, of course, a very unsatisfactory state of things here as in other nations
eastward, nor is it likely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220">220</a>]</span>to be much improved under Spanish rule. And yet we must never forget that it is a
time-honoured institution, and is not, to say the least, more objectionable than polyandry
as practised among the tribes who live on the banks of the Upper Jumna and Upper Ganges.
Polygamy is sanctioned by custom, and &#x201c;custom is religion in the East.&#x201d; Each Mahomedan
is permitted to have four wives. Before we blame a religion so wide spread and powerful,
however, we must not forget that it is a religion which practically preserves its
millions of followers from other forms of intemperance, and notably from the use of
intoxicating liquors, that great bane of many Englishmen everywhere, and especially
of many of those who live in the Eastern tropics.
</p>
<p>The language spoken in Sulu, notwithstanding that it contains many Malay words and
others of Arabic origin, is yet practically very distinct, approaching much more nearly
that spoken by the inland tribes of Northern Borneo. In physique and bold fearless
bearing there is also a striking resemblance between the north Borneans and the Sulus,
while both races display the same acuteness, mingled with suspicion, in all matters
of trade. So striking is the resemblance in physique, language, and conduct, as to
suggest the possibility of their having originally descended from one common stock,
and I am inclined to think that the same language was used by them before the advent
of the now dominant Malays, who had Arabic blood in their veins, and to whom is doubtless
due the introduction of the Arabic character and Islamism, and whose language is now
the <i lang="fr">lingua franca</i> of Malasia. The government of the island, although in a great measure in the hands
of the Sultan, can scarcely be called despotic, since the people are represented in
the council chamber, or &#x201c;ruma bichari,&#x201d; by their Datus or headmen, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221">221</a>]</span>and but few if any important matters were decided by the Sultan personally, without
the opinion of the native chiefs. During our visit to the Istana His Highness regretted
very much that he had not power to drive out the Spaniards.
</p>
<p>The cultural capabilities of the island are considerable, and in the hands of the
Spaniards they are likely to be still better developed. The principal cultivated crops
are rice, maize, coffee, manilla hemp, cocoa (<i lang="la">Theobroma Cacao</i>), tobacco, and tapioca. During the rides I took in the island I had good opportunities
of seeing the arable land, and I was much impressed with the produce obtainable from
the soil at a slight expenditure of labour. The deep soil is loosened by a rude plough,
drawn by a single buffalo. This is done in the dry season, and seed sowing and planting
commence with the rainy weather. I saw coffee bushes growing apparently wild around
the little farm-houses on the cool hill-sides, especially on Bu&#x2019;at Dahau, which I
ascended a few days after our return from Bu&#x2019;at Timantangis, and every leaf was fresh
and green without a trace of the leaf fungus which of late years has proved so hurtful
in Ceylon. The cocoa-yielding Theobroma does equally well and fruits freely, forming
indeed what may be called the national beverage in Sulu. Excellent tobacco is grown
here, and this, if skilfully prepared, would furnish cigars equal to those of Manilla.
Cotton would do well, and the highest red land on the mountains, rich as it is with
ages of forest <span class="corr" id="xd29e2568" title="Source: debris"><i>débris</i></span>, might be advantageously planted with coffee or other crops. Rice, tapioca, tobacco,
and sugar cane would do best on the plains. An immense quantity of fruit is produced
in the island, especially mangoes and bananas. The fragrant durian is also plentiful,
together with langsat, and several other kinds. I noticed two distinct varieties of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222">222</a>]</span>cocoa-nut cultivated here, one bearing small oblong fruits of a bright orange yellow
colour, the milk of which was delicious in flavour, and another, the outer husk of
which could be eaten in its young state, it being white as ivory, and very sweet and
tender.
</p>
<p>I have already alluded to a breed of ponies as being peculiar to the island. These
are larger and in every way better than the Deli breed, imported to Singapore from
Sumatra. They are never shod, nor is emasculation ever resorted to. Goats and poultry
are very abundant. Of the former, a dark brown race resembling deer in gracefulness
and activity, are kept by the hill people. The fowls of Sulu are distinct from those
of Borneo, and are believed not to be many degrees removed from their wild prototypes.
Of the other natural produce of the island the frutto del mare deserves notice, being
especially valuable, worth, indeed, many thousands of dollars yearly. Pearls of all
colours in quantity and of excellent quality, are obtained here yearly by the divers,
most of whom are of the ubiquitous Badjow or Sea gipsy race. Tons of pearl shell (tepoy)
and sea slug or beche de mer (<i lang="la">Holothuria</i>), of different kinds, are also exported annually.
</p>
<p>This last repulsive-looking product is picked off the coral reefs at low water, and
after being dried is esteemed a great delicacy by the Chinese, to whom it is sold.
The pearl-shell obtained here is of fine quality, each valve being frequently as large
as an ordinary dinner-plate, and an inch in thickness. At least a dozen kinds of salt-water
fish are obtainable, and I frequently saw the fishing-boats off the town at night,
each with a light gleaming over the water, and I noticed that they all seemed to have
secured a fair supply of fish when they came alongside in the morning.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When we started from Labuan it was expected that the whole voyage to and from Sulu
would be made in fifteen days. On our arrival here, however, the expected cargo was
not ready, and it was found that another fortnight must elapse ere we could leave.
This extra time I spent in riding over the island in every direction, and I was rewarded
by specimens of plants and birds which had never reached Europe before. One night
on my return to the ship for dinner, I was delighted to hear that the Sultan had arranged
to pay a State visit to Meimbong, and that he had signified his intention of coming
on board, this being indeed one of the principal reasons of his visit. It had been
arranged that he and his suite would remain in the harbour for one night, sleeping
in &#x201c;Peah&#x2019;s&#x201d; house, the largest and most comfortable in the place. Mr. Cowie at once
resolved to decorate the ship, and also to fire a salute from the guns on board, as
he had an Armstrong amidships and two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224">224</a>]</span>iron muzzle-loaders forward. The visit was to be made in two days&#x2019; time, and so there
was plenty of time for preparations, and the little wharf assumed an appearance of
bustle and activity I had never seen there before. A fine young bullock was slaughtered
by &#x201c;Peah,&#x201d; and his slave girls were as busy as bees in the little kitchen on the end
of the pile jetty, preparing food and sweetmeats for the visitors. Edible swallows&#x2019;
nests, and the finest and fattest of sea-slugs were placed in bowls of water to soak,
while rice was cleaned in large quantities, and freshly-caught fish were brought in
alive and retained in tubs of sea-water until required. Enormous brass betel-boxes
were cleaned and replenished with fresh lime and nuts, and the mountaineers brought
down the largest and freshest of pepper or sirri leaves and fruits on the morning
of the visit. Inside the private apartments finely-worked mats and embroidered cushions
were placed for the royal guests. Business seemed entirely suspended for the time,
and both Chinese and Sulus were evidently looking forward to a general holiday. On
board, the sailors had made the little <i>Far East</i> nice and tidy, the bunting of all colours and signal halyards were got into order,
and the mate sacrificed his old flannel shirts to make bags for the powder with which
the salute was to be fired.

<p class="first"><i>To face page 225.</i></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>About eight o&#x2019;clock on the appointed day a shot was fired from the Armstrong, and
we were all surprised at the long rolling echo and reverberation it made among the
hills. About ten the Sultan and Sultana with their entire suite and numbers of Sulus
who formed a sort of irregular guard of honour, arrived at Meimbong a gay cavalcade,
the brightly-embroidered jackets of the nobles, and the crimson, blue, and yellow
petticoats of the ladies being very effective in the bright sunshine, the whole <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225">225</a>]</span>effect being again heightened by the flashing of numerous spears. Filing through the
narrow gate in the stockade, they waited for some minutes ere the boats were quite
ready, and then embarked, a movement which occupied nearly half an hour. Knowing that
the boats would block up the river when they eventually started, we returned to the
ship, from which an excellent view of the procession of boats was obtained as they
crossed the harbour to reach the houses on the wharf. The sight was extremely bright
and pretty as the boats, with their gaily attired occupants, emerged from the mouth
of the river and came across the bay. The Sultan&#x2019;s boat was first, and the fat old
Commander-in-Chief of the forces sat on the prow, paddle in hand, to steer clear of
all impediments. Next came the Sultana and her chief ladies in a larger boat, two
or three richly embroidered umbrellas being held aloft, while her infant son and nurse
came along in a third boat with numerous attendants, and overshadowed by a splendid
yellow silk three storied umbrella, decorated with streamers to steady it, each of
these last being in the hands of a dusky slave. The following boats, of which there
were about a dozen, carried the attendant nobles, headmen, minor ladies of the harem,
and the necessary attendants or slaves. Besides these there was, of course, quite
a crowd of natives in outrigged boats and canoes of all sizes.
</p>
<p>His Highness landed on the &#x201c;jimbatan,&#x201d; and stood to watch the landing of the Sultana
and her suite. He was surrounded by his people, all being, as is usual here always,
armed. One man carried a heavy Lanun sword, while two others carried loaded revolvers
in a very awkward manner. His son, Datu Mahomed, came on board as soon as he landed,
and asked Mr. Cowie not to fire the salute until the ladies had retired indoors. He
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226">226</a>]</span>had several young followers with him all smartly dressed in embroidered jackets and
breeches, with gaudy kerchiefs wound around their heads. He stayed on board while
the salute was being fired, and although it shook the little vessel a good deal, and
did some damage to the skylights and crockery, he did not seem to mind it much. The
guns were fired with great regularity, and the reverberation among the hills was grand.
After the firing was concluded His Highness came on board and went over the whole
ship. He was particularly interested in the little Armstrong breech-loading gun, and
examined its mechanism very closely, he also ventured down into the engine-room, and
was evidently astonished at the machinery therein. After looking round the vessel
he sat under the awning on the saloon-deck smoking and talking until we had finished
dinner, and was very much interested in our European style of eating. He has repeatedly
been invited on board English gun-boats which call in here occasionally, but this
was the first time he had ever ventured to set his foot on board a foreign vessel.
Mr. Cowie was very anxious that all should pass off well, as it was very evident that
His Highness was very nervous, and foreseeing this possibility, the vessel had been
laid alongside the &#x201c;jimbatan,&#x201d; or wharf, so that he could step on board and leave
without any trouble.
</p>
<p>He left just at sundown, appearing very pleased with his visit, and he expressed his
intention of again coming on board in the morning, bringing the Sultana with him.
The houses on the wharf were crowded towards night with Sulus from all the neighbouring
islets, and when the lamps were alight presented a very animated sight to a stranger.
The common Sulus are rather intrusive, and the native boatswain would have had much
trouble to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>have kept the ship clear of them had it not been for the dogs on board, four splendid
creatures. They were a retriever, two small terriers, and a formidable bull-dog, which
Mr. Cowie told me was the best safeguard from the pilfering of natives he had ever
invested in during some years of Eastern cruising and coast trade. This hint may be
of some service to future explorers&#x2014;a good bull-dog or a terrier or two would, indeed,
be the best of guards to have at one&#x2019;s camping ground, since it is next to impossible
for anyone to approach without their giving due loud-voiced warning.
</p>
<p>We went ashore after dinner and found &#x201c;Peah&#x2019;s&#x201d; house filled to overflowing with guests.
Room, however, was made for us, and chocolate, biscuits, cigarettes, and gin offered
in turn. Incessant talking, varied by gong music, and now and then a melancholy song
by one of the court ladies, together with food and drink to all comers, seemed to
be the programme. The singing, to our ears, sounded like a dirge&#x2014;the pentatonic scale
being used by these people as by the Malays and Chinese. One young girl after singing
part of a ballad relating how a beautiful princess was stolen by pirates and eventually
became a Sultan&#x2019;s bride, &#x201c;her skin being pale as the jasmine flower, her breath sweet
as the areca bloom,&#x201d; eventually went off in a fainting fit, and had to be carried
out into the fresh air. Her place and legend was immediately taken up by another girl,
and I was told that the thread of it was so long that several days would be occupied
by anyone who should attempt to sing the whole story. Our interpreter, for the nonce,
was Datu Mahomed, who is very fond of Europeans. He introduced us to several people
of note in the island, and gave us much information which otherwise we could not have
obtained. Men and women here met pretty <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228">228</a>]</span>much on a common ground, and were apparently untrammelled by that strict and exclusive
etiquette so characteristic of the Bornean Malays. Some of the ladies were very comely
and richly dressed, notably the court ladies and the pretty wife of Datu Haroun, the
former Sulu governor of Sandakan. This lady spoke Malay well, an accomplishment which
few of the Sulu women possess, and we spent a very pleasant quarter of an hour in
her company.
</p>
<p>The dress of the Sulu women consists of a pair of loose trowsers of white cloth generally,
but for holiday times often red, yellow, magenta, or blue silk, and a loose jacket
(&#x201c;baju&#x201d;) also of silk, often braided down the front, and ornamented with large gold
or silver buttons. Over these a long sarong, or petticoat, is worn as a sash, cloak,
skirt, or petticoat and belt combined, according to the fancy of its wearer at the
time, for to the Sulus and Malays the sarong supplies the place of the dress and bonnet
of civilised society here at home. Most of the &#x201c;sarongs&#x201d; worn by the ladies I saw
to-day were of silk, very richly embroidered with flowers, butterflies, or complicated
designs of a foliated pattern, the same on both sides the material, and really producing
a beautiful effect. The colours were mainly gaudy and barbaric in splendour, but here
and there real taste was evident. One lady wore a buff sarong of very rich texture,
with a neatly-worked border in black, while another, in a green and black check or
tartan, was especially noticeable. Rings of gold and silver, often richly set with
stones and pearls, are worn on the left hand as a rule, but ladies of the highest
class have both hands studded with jewelry. Ear ornaments are not so much affected
as by the Malays, and although most of the girls have apertures slit in their pretty
little ears, these are rarely used for earrings, being, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229">229</a>]</span>indeed, as often made receptacles for cigarettes as anything else. Ornate cloth or
silk kerchiefs and head-dresses of black, yellow, or red, set off their raven tresses
to advantage on high days and holidays, and among an assemblage of fully two hundred
women, such as we saw here to-day, not two were dressed alike. Yellow is the colour
which predominates most, and the amount of chrome which would render a European lady
most conspicuous and vulgar, seems only to enhance the dusky charms, bright eyes,
and luxuriant hair of these Sulu belles. Only the Sultana and one or two others wore
stockings, and slippers were only used by the elite, and to these they seemed a superfluity,
since they mostly carried them in their hands. The abundance of hair possessed by
these women is a noticeable feature, and they do not dress it so neatly as the Malays,
but merely comb it out straight, after which it is loosely knotted up so as to form
a mass on the top or one side of the head.
</p>
<p>From the opportunities I had of seeing the Sulu women generally, I should say that
they are far superior to the men, and evidently have, as has been before noticed,
great influence with their husbands. A present to the Sultana and one or two of the
Datu&#x2019;s wives, would be amply sufficient to ensure the safety and popularity of a traveller
here, a secret well known to the rich Chinese traders, who make visits hither occasionally
during the year. Wishing to pay our respects to the Sultan ere leaving for the night,
we sought His Highness in vain for some time, but at last found him with one of our
Chinese friends, smoking opium in a gloomy little compartment, from the close, penetrating
odour of which we were glad to escape as quickly as possible. We went on board, but
did not sleep much, owing to the talking and gong-beating, which continued almost
all night. We <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230">230</a>]</span>awoke at sunrise to find nearly every one astir on the wharf, the Sultana and her
suite having thus early seated themselves outside the houses to take the air.
</p>
<p>Much amusement was caused by a large retriever dog, &#x201c;Neptune,&#x201d; which Mr. Cowie had
on board, and which delighted to plunge after any trifle flung into the water. In
about half-an-hour the boats were brought, and Her Highness and about fifty ladies
went off to a sandy shoal in the bay to bathe. We could see them quite plainly from
the ship flopping over the sides of the boats into the sea, and floundering about
like fat seals. They evidently enjoyed themselves; and after a quarter-of-an-hour&#x2019;s
racing and splashing, they returned to the boats, and then proceeded about a mile
out to sea, where some Badjows amused them by diving for pearl-shells and coral.
</p>
<p>Returning to the wharf, the Sultan and Sultana came on board; and after Her Highness,
who was only attended by two of her ladies, had looked over the ship, he bade us adieu.
The boats were then brought alongside the wharf; the ladies embarked first, then the
Sultan and his suite. Splash went the polished paddles; a wave of the hand from His
Highness, a dip of the flag at the mast-head of the little steamer, and the first
royal visit paid by a Sultan of Sulu on board a steam-ship was over. Both before and
after this visit we saw a good deal of the Sulus; not only the traders, but the nobles
and officers themselves often came on board on business, or to take a cup of tea and
have a chat. One or two of them had a weakness for gin &#x201c;cocktails,&#x201d; but their general
beverage was tea or lemonade. All were armed with straight knives; but most had the
short heavy Sulu knife or sword stuck in a silk sash or waist-cloth. Much of the conversation
was on the subject of market prices for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231">231</a>]</span>pearl shell, trepang, and birds&#x2019; nests, varied by inquiries as to the object and operations
of the new Borneo Company, to whom their Sultan had quite recently ceded Sandakan,
and the east and north part of Borneo which belonged to him.
</p>
<p>During all the time we had lain in harbour here, the weather had been dry, not a drop
of rain having fallen for nearly four months. The plains were very dry and parched,
and jungle fires were not unfrequent as the dry grass caught fire and sprang into
a blaze very quickly. It is owing to these fires in jungle and forest that teak of
large size is now so rare; since at one time the island must have been one immense
forest of this valuable wood.
</p>
<p>After the ascent of Bu&#x2019;at Timantangis I had often longed to explore Bu&#x2019;at Dahau, the
next highest of the two peaks of Sulu, both of which are visible for a long way out
at sea. We could see the mountain quite clearly at sunrise every morning, from our
anchorage at Meimbong; and one fine morning I set off, accompanied by Mr. Anson Cowie,
who proved himself to be a most intelligent and genial companion. As guide, I had
been so fortunate as to obtain the services of one of the Sultan&#x2019;s officers who lived
at a village half way up the mountain side, and at whose house we were to leave our
ponies and undertake the climbing on foot. We bore to the right on leaving Meimbong,
and had a pleasant ride of seven or eight miles across the fragrant mint and grass-covered
plains; but by reason of my dismounting here and there to gather a curious orchid
or fern, or perchance to get a shot at a beautiful bird, it was nearly noon ere we
drew rein at the door of our guide&#x2019;s house. Our way at first had lain through the
undulating plain; then the Meimbong river was crossed under some fine-spreading trees,
on which white, blue, and green pigeons fluttered in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232">232</a>]</span>plenty. Then we rode up a narrow path fringed with tall overhanging jungle on either
side, leaving only bare space for our ponies to pass in Indian file. Then came a rounded
hill-side, and numerous cultivated patches&#x2014;little farms with palm-thatched houses
sheltered in groves of durian, cocoa-nut, mango, and other fruit trees. Here coffee
and cocoa-trees were noticed in vigorous health and fruitfulness; and along the edges
of the arable patches a very pretty species of curcuma was blooming freely among the
grass and verdure. The leaves had a purple stain along the mid-rib. The flowers were
white, with a blotch of lemon-yellow on the lip, the inflorescence being white, suffused
with bright amethyst, purple at its apex. We noticed tame paroquets hanging outside
several of the dwellings we passed on our way.
</p>
<p>At one point near the foot of the mountain, we came upon a party of thirty or forty
men accompanied by dogs, and armed with long spears; they were going to hunt some
wild pigs which had done damage to a plantation of sweet potatoes and yams the night
previous. Our way now lay up the clearings on the mountain side. I dismounted and
led my pony; and on my shooting at a pigeon, it became restive, and broke away. It
was luckily met and caught by a Sulu man who had followed us, in the hope of earning
a little tobacco. Arriving at last at the mountain village, we entered our guide&#x2019;s
house, after having tethered our horses and given them some cut grass on which to
feed. The sun was now very hot, and we were glad to rest; we were hungry, too, and
thoroughly enjoyed some fish and rice, which, together with some chocolate, was soon
set before us by these hospitable people. Pigeons, paroquets, and large hornbills,
were here plentiful, and came to feed on some large trees which were in fruit near
the village.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233">233</a>]</span></p>
<p>After our luncheon I started with our guides to ascend the mountain, leaving Mr. Cowie,
who had a lame foot, to shoot around the village until my return. We reached the summit
in about an hour, but were much disappointed, as the vegetation was not nearly so
luxuriant as that on Timantangis. Orchids were scarce, and ferns wanting in variety
and beauty, although several were new to science. Near the summit I heard a little
song-bird singing very sweetly; and although I did not see it, I am convinced it was
the same species I had previously heard with so much pleasure on &#x201c;Kina Balu,&#x201d; at a
much higher altitude. This mountain is well wooded at the top, but not so densely
as is Timantangis; nor is the undergrowth so rich in variety. The views from the top
are simply lovely&#x2014;a panorama of fertile farm-dotted hills and golden plains, stretching
away to the blue sea, where the main island is fringed by coral islets. A native pointed
out the harbour to us, and the peak of Pulo Siassi was plainly visible. In the descent
I made a detour from the little spring or watering-place near the village, and passing
through clumps of coffee-bushes, with here and there ripe fruit in plenty, we came
beneath a grove of large durian trees which were in bloom, the ground beneath being
covered with their fallen blossoms. Here I shot several pigeons and paroquets; and
in returning to the village we repeatedly saw a large amorphophallus bearing f&#x153;tid
flowers as large as a sugar basin, and of a dark maroon colour. On cutting open a
flower I found its basin half full of ants of two kinds and numerous small black coleoptera
were running about in the spathe. I may say that I have rarely ever examined tubular
flowers here in the tropics without finding insects of some kind engaged within, and
in the case of aroids particularly, their spathes are generally full of such tiny
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234">234</a>]</span>guests, whether &#x201c;unbidden&#x201d; or not I cannot say, but it is probable certain kinds are
attracted by f&#x153;tid odours as others are by sweet ones, while in many cases nectar
or pollen supply the little visitors with food. The bright scarlet flowers of the
erythrina trees in Labuan sheltered myriads of tiny flies and beetles which, in their
turn, afforded food to large flocks of starlings and other birds which were always
attracted to these trees when they were in bloom. Quite accidentally I came across
the evidence of a celebrated traveller in South America, Waterton, who at p. 98 of
his <i>Wanderings</i>, says &#x201c;almost every flower of the tropical climates contains insects of one kind
or other,&#x201d; thus bearing out what I have observed to be universally the case in the
eastern jungles and gardens.
</p>
<p>On returning to the house I found Mr. Cowie had shot a beautiful paroquet and two
pigeons I had never seen before, and he had directed his men to bring all the ferns
and plants he had met with on his way around the jungle patches near the houses. Our
birds and flowers securely packed, we walked around the village and paid a visit to
a hospitable old hadji who lived here, apparently prosperous and happy. He told us
that many of the women had been much frightened on hearing that a white man was coming
to their village, adding that he had had great difficulty in assuring them that we
were not Spaniards. He had erected a neat little musjid, and his son, a tall well-favoured
youth, who had accompanied his sire to Mecca, had just been married to a very comely
Sulu girl. This hadji had a tradition that the aboriginals of the island had been
driven out by the Chinese emigrants many years ago, even before the Arab Sultans and
Datus became the dominant party here. He may be right, since it is a well known fact
that the Chinese <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235">235</a>]</span>had extensive settlements in the northern portion of Borneo, as in part attested by
the native names of the places in which their settlements were made, as Kina Balu
(Chinese widow mountain), Kina Batangan (Chinese river), Kina Tanah, Kina Taki, and
others. There is one tribe of Dusun who wear pigtails, and although they use the Dusun
vernacular, yet they converse in very fair Chinese after a little practice, having
never quite lost the tongue of their Chinese ancestors, of whom these are the lineal
descendants by Bornean women. This peculiar tribe inhabit the Bundu country, but St.
John mentions Muruts from the Limbang, who spoke Hokien Chinese on their being confronted
with Chinese in Brunei, the capital, although they failed to express themselves in
the Malay language of the coast!
</p>
<p>Just as the sun was sinking behind the trees we mounted our ponies and started for
Meimbong. The air was now cool and fresh, and a pleasant ride of two hours brought
us to Meimbong. This was my last ride in the island. All the cargo had been stowed
below, the hatches closed, and early in the morning we were to leave. We were awoke
at daybreak by the steam-whistle, and just as the sun tinted the peaks of Timantangis
and Dahau we steamed slowly out of the harbour for the Island of Siassi, one of the
Tapal group, where more cargo awaited us. We arrived at Siassi about noon, but the
cargo could not be put on board until the next morning. We stayed at Siassi all the
following day, and I took the opportunity of riding inland, and to the peak, which
I found capped with old forest; but owing to the extreme drought, everything here
was parched and dry, and but few plants of interest were seen. As most of this island
is entirely denuded of old forest, of course birds are scarce; indeed, I saw enough
of it to convince me that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236">236</a>]</span>it was a bad collecting ground generally. The only steed I could obtain was a large
black bull, which I hired for a bundle of tobacco. He was all right when I had fairly
mounted, but whenever I got off to shoot at a bird, or gather plants, he became exceedingly
restive, and the only way to mount him again was to put the rope (by which I steered
him, and which was fastened to a twisted ring of rattan cane in his nose) round the
trunk or branch of a tree, and then to pull his nose up to it by sheer force, holding
it firmly with one hand while I sprang on his back. The few country people I met appeared
rather surprised, but I expect the bull was well known, and so that served as a passport
to me. Near the houses on the shore a bushy euphorbia, with candelabra-like branches,
and a clump of yuccas were seen, both doubtless introductions. I returned about three
o&#x2019;clock. After dinner I and Captain Cowie visited one or two of the traders&#x2019; houses,
which resemble those of Sulu in internal arrangement, large beds or platforms occupying
the principal apartment, covered with fine mats and pillows, the valuables in boxes
being piled up behind. In the morning we bore away for Sandakan, which we reached
ere daybreak the next day. The steam-ship <i>America</i> was in the bay, having Baron de Overbeck on board. We stayed here one day for cargo
of trepang, rattan, pearl-shell, and birds&#x2019;-nests. These edible swallows&#x2019;-nests are
highly valued by the rich Chinese, and it is from a cave on the face of the sandstone
rock on Pulo Bahalatolois, at the mouth of this bay, that the finest white nests are
obtained. These rocks rise nearly perpendicularly from the sea, and to reach the entrance
to the cave a man has to descend a distance of a hundred or more feet with the aid
of a rattan rope tied to a tree on the slope above. It is dangerous work, as the least
slip, and the man would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237">237</a>]</span>be dashed to pieces on the rock-strewn shore below. The nests thus obtained fetch
as much as eighteen dollars per catty, a weight equalling 1&#x2153; lb. English. The finest
birds&#x2019;-nests are clean and white, as if made of isinglass; the worst resemble dirty
glue, to which feathers and other impurities are attached, and between these extremes
there are all sorts of intermediate qualities. These nests are obtained in rocky caves
throughout Borneo, Java, and Sumatra, but nowhere are they obtainable finer in quality
than here, at Sandakan Head. Large quantities of small or seed pearls are obtained
here, also Bornean camphor, the produce of <i lang="la">Dryobalanops camphora</i>, a large tree often one hundred to a hundred and fifty feet in height. As a product,
it is quite distinct from the common camphor of commerce, which is obtained from <i lang="la">Laurus camphora</i> by the Chinese of Hong Kong, who send nearly all of it to our markets, while they,
in their turn, highly esteem the Bornean produce, and pay high prices for it. It is
obtained in the form of tears and crystallised lumps from the trunk of the tree, and
in general appearance is so like the finer kinds of &#x201c;dammar&#x201d; gum, that this latter
is often used by the collectors as an adulterant. The Chinese traders, however, are
rarely imposed upon. The camphor, in its pure state, resembles solidified spirit,
and being extremely volatile, it burns with a clear light flame. To detect adulteration,
the Chinese are said to spread a little on a white cloth and set it on fire; the pure
camphor burns cleanly, and does not soil the cloth, whereas the dammar, if such is
mixed with it, melts and sets the cloth on fire. The people from the Teutong river,
and the Kayans on the Baram, collect large quantities of camphor and caoutchouc, and
prahus with a cargo of these products, worth from one to two thousand dollars, visit
Labuan, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238">238</a>]</span>Sarawak, and other ports during the season. On our leaving Sandakan, on our return
voyage to Labuan, we obtained a capital view of Pulo Bahalatolois, and on our rounding
the point, the rattan rope dangling down the rocks to the dark entrance to the swallows&#x2019;
cave was plainly visible. This island has a very commanding position, and a battery
here would sweep the entrance to this fine bay. We were four days in reaching Labuan,
there being a thick fog along the north-west coast, and we were aground twice, although
fortunately we got off again without injury.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was now the end of July, and I had been waiting four or five days, expecting the
arrival of the steam-ship <i>Far East</i>, in which I had hoped to have again taken a passage, with my friend, Captain W.&nbsp;C.
Cowie; but as his vessel was now overdue, and my own time was limited, I resolved
to leave in a native boat at all hazards. I soon chartered a prahu, large enough to
carry twenty men, and our stores; and on July 31st I was ready to start. I had given
my Chinese &#x201c;boy,&#x201d; Kimjeck, and the men orders to have all in readiness; but when I
reached the little jetty, at two <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, I found only half the men there, the remainder being as busy as bees on shore, running
in and out of the Chinese shops, buying betel-nut, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240">240</a>]</span>salt, dried fish, onions, and other private stores for the voyage. As soon as they
saw me, however, they came running down, and we all went on board. Altogether our
craft was heavily laden; but as these native boats are generally carefully built,
we saw nothing to fear.
</p>
<p>At 3.30 we bade our friends, who had kindly come down to see us start, &#x201c;good-bye;&#x201d;
and, amid the cries of &#x201c;Salaamat jelan!&#x201d; from the men&#x2019;s friends on shore, we hove
anchor, and sheered off with a tolerably good wind. We soon got our large mat-sail
hauled up, and with the Union Jack astern (we carried the &#x201c;mails&#x201d; for Tampassuk by
the way), glided out of the harbour, and, rounding the old flagstaff-point, steered
nearly due north. We did this, intending to stand out, and make &#x201c;Pulo Tiga,&#x201d; an island
lying about forty miles northward of Labuan, by the morning. In this, however, we
were doomed to disappointment; for after an hour or two of indifferent sailing, a
bit of a squall arose, and the wind having changed, we hove in shore, towards Lumbedan,
intending to anchor under the shelter of a little islet of the same name for the night,
and start away in the early morning.
</p>
<p>This was now the only judicious course left us, since we were close in-shore, on a
dangerous coast, and the squall of wind and rain was coming down on us like a hurricane.
Our men pulled in around the island, and were approaching the shore, to enable us
to land, when the boat rose a little on the surf, and the next moment her bows came
down on a rock, and this knocked a large hole in her bottom. We subsequently found
out that all her lower timbers were rotten. Happily we were not far from the land,
and could make ashore, or the consequences might have been serious. As it was we suffered
enough, being drenched with rain and surf; and as the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241">241</a>]</span>boat rolled about, and filled rapidly, most of our things got drenched likewise. As
is usual with Malays on such occasions, there was a great deal of excitement, and
everybody shouted orders or instructions to his neighbour.
</p>
<p>However, Smith, an excellent fellow Mr. Boosie had allowed to accompany me, and one
or two natives, handed out our clothes and personal effects, which others carried
ashore, after which we got out the bags of rice, and other stores all safely, and
having emptied the craft of all her loose gear, we hauled her up on the smooth sandy
beach, and then, as it was getting dusk, set about preparing ourselves a habitation
for the night. Some of the men were sent to cut firewood, others to cut timbers for
our hut; others went to search for water, while my &#x201c;boy,&#x201d; hastily securing a few dry
sticks, lighted a fire, and began preparing our evening meal.
</p>
<p>We had with us plenty of the common &#x201c;kajang&#x201d; mats, which may be purchased in Labuan
for a few pence each, and serve admirably for roofing boats, or the little jungle-houses,
for which a Malay will cut and fix timbers in a few minutes. We had also a good oil-cloth,
twelve feet square; and in less than an hour after our shipwreck we had a roomy tent
erected in which to eat and sleep. We soon got on some dry clothes, and then had our
bedding placed at one end, with our baggage piled up behind, and at the other end
our rice and dried fish, goods for barter with the natives, and other stores, were
arranged. The guns, rifle, and the tower-muskets, carried by the men, together with
our revolvers, &amp;c., were cleaned, and oiled, and suspended overhead; and the lamp
being lighted, and hung in the centre, we began to look quite cheerful.
</p>
<p>We had our dinner about seven o&#x2019;clock, and then a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242">242</a>]</span>smoke and a chat over our misadventure. Several men came over from the opposite coast
of Lumbedan, where there are a few native houses, to look at us; and I asked them
to bring over a boat in the morning, which they very civilly promised to do. About
nine o&#x2019;clock we sought our blankets, and turned in for the night, and slept well,
notwithstanding our recent mishap.
</p>
<p><i>August 1st.</i>&#x2014;We were all astir by daybreak this morning; and, after having had our customary cup
of coffee and dry toast, we set our followers to work to spread out the wet rice on
mats in the sun, and to rearrange all our stores. Some of the men were sent to cut
down &#x201c;nebong&#x201d; palms, the young tops of which form a delicious vegetable when boiled,
and others were employed in cleaning our arms, cutting fire-wood, and other necessary
work. While this was going on, I took my gun, and went out on a stroll around our
little island. The vegetation I found was rather dense, and the whole surface rocky.
I noticed several species of palms, and an epiphytal fern or two, and plants of the
white-flowered <i lang="la">Dendrobium crumenatum</i> hung here and there on the trees.
</p>
<p>I shot two of the beautiful white island pigeon (<i lang="la">Carpophaga bicolor</i>), called &#x201c;Pragam pulo&#x201d; by the natives, and a larger species, of an ash colour (<i lang="la">C. ænea</i>), the wings and neck being shot with purple and bronze tints. This is a very large
and handsome bird, common in Borneo, and when cooked, is very good eating. On my return
to the tent I found the man from the coast had brought over his boat, as promised,
and I at once sent it off, with eleven of my men, with a letter to Mr. A. Boosie,
the manager of the coal mines in Labuan, asking him to lend me one of his boats, in
which to continue my journey.
</p>
<p>It is a lovely day to-day, and our rice and clothes are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243">243</a>]</span>getting dry again. &#x201c;Kimjeck,&#x201d; after he had done his work this morning, started off
on a collecting excursion, and has just returned, with a couple of broad-tailed, dusky-coloured
rock-snakes, one a very fine specimen. Beetles and butterflies, he tells me, are alike
unobtainable, and he can find no flowers, so that we can do no collecting on the island.
Knowing that it will be night at the earliest ere our own men can possibly return
with the boat, I and Smith went over to Lumbedan with some natives, who had come in
a boat to look at us, and had a walk in the tall forest, which forms a back-ground
to the houses near the shore. Here we found the &#x201c;nebong&#x201d; palm attaining to a large
size; and some woodcutters promised to cut us a few young tops by the time of our
return.
</p>
<p>This forest, although originally rich in plants, like that of Labuan, has suffered
severely during recent years from the now ever recurring jungle-fires of the dry monsoon.
We could find nothing of interest. A large-leaved crinum grows in the sand by the
shore; and a scarlet-flowered ixora with narrow foliage, was blooming here and there
in patches. We shot a long-tailed paroquet, and a blue kingfisher, the only birds
we saw, and retraced our steps to the village just before sunset. We were thoroughly
tired, and rested here some time, watching the young Kadyans playing at <span class="corr" id="xd29e2720" title="Source: foot-ball">football</span> on the beach. The players stand in a circle, three or four yards in diameter, and
the ball is kicked in the air by the player to whom it falls nearest. To do this properly
requires great dexterity, as the ball is struck with the sole of the foot; and a party
of good players will thus keep a ball in the air for several minutes by each kicking
it upwards just as it is about to fall. The ball itself is a light hollow one, of
rattan open-work, about the size of an ordinary cricket-ball; and the game closely
resembles shuttlecock, as played in China.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244">244</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having obtained our palm-tops, we purchased some eggs, cucumbers, and fine ripe water-melons
from the woodcutters, whom we had passed in the forest in the morning, and then waded
across to our quarters on the island, which we could now do, as it was low water.
It was becoming dusk, and we were glad to throw ourselves down on our rugs, and rest
a little before we ate our frugal repast. During our absence my &#x201c;boy&#x201d; has &#x201c;tidied
up&#x201d; the tent, and it now looks quite cosy and comfortable, being dry and sheltered,
although on two sides the sea washes up to within a few feet of us at high water.
The soft yellow mats are pleasantly enlivened with our rugs and scarlet blankets,
the rifle-barrels glisten above our heads, and the smoke curls gracefully upwards
from our cooking-fires on the beach. Just as it was dark we heard our men shouting;
and soon after six of them came in with the borrowed prahu, and told us that their
companions were following them in the large boat, which Mr. Boosie had kindly lent
to us. This was good news; and we ate our dinner in high spirits. In about an hour&#x2019;s
time the men came in with the boat, and we hauled her up high and dry on the sandy
shore before retiring for the night. With the boat I was cheered by letters from several
of my friends in Labuan, all of whom were sorry to hear of our disaster.
</p>
<p><i>August 2nd.</i>&#x2014;A lovely morning. We were up before daybreak, and soon had our boat launched, and
all our goods and stores safely stowed away, ready for starting. About seven o&#x2019;clock
we got away, with a good breeze behind us, and then we took our breakfast in a little
deck-cabin, which our men had cleverly rigged up for us with a few crooked sticks,
tied firmly with rattans, and covered with kajang mats, thus forming a capital shelter
from sun and rain. Not feeling very well, I lay <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245">245</a>]</span>down, and fell asleep, but was soon awakened by a consternation among the men, and
much shouting. A refractory fish was the cause of all the noise, the steersman having
hooked him; but the fish was large, and objected to come on board. After much trouble
they hauled in their capture, and a fine fellow it was, fully thirty pounds weight.
</p>
<p>We were very comfortable in our new craft, which sailed well; and although the wind
slackened considerably about noon, we reached Pulo Tiga before sunset, and went ashore
to cook our dinner and lay in a fresh stock of firewood and water. Half-a-dozen fires
were soon alight, and we took our guns, and went for a walk, but failed to get a shot.
We caught sight of some large hornbills; they were, however, too wary to allow us
within range.
</p>
<p>This island is a large one, without any inhabitants, except now and then a few Chinese
woodcutters, or native fishermen. Native boats from Sulu or Palawan frequently call
for wood and water; and the remains of numerous fires occur among the drift wood along
the beach. Wild pigs are very plentiful, and turtle are also found here. From a distance
the island is seen to consist of three rounded hills, covered with forest; hence its
native name &#x201c;tiga,&#x201d; or &#x201c;teega,&#x201d; signifying three in the Malay language. We returned
to dinner with hearty appetites, and thoroughly enjoyed a portion of the fish we had
captured in the morning. My &#x201c;boy,&#x201d; who acted as cook, had forgotten to inquire how
he should prepare it; and so, to make sure, he had divided our share, boiling one-half,
and the other he cleverly roasted over the clean embers of a wood-fire.
</p>
<p>Hungry as we were, salmon from an Irish stream, cooked fresh over a fire of strawberry-tree
wood (<i lang="la">Arbutus</i>), <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246">246</a>]</span>could not have tasted more delicious. The wind had now completely died away, and the
current setting in strong against us, we anchored in a sheltered bay until the morning.
</p>
<p><i>August 3rd.</i>&#x2014;Awoke about three <span class="sc">A.M.</span>, and finding a fresh breeze springing up, we aroused our men, and got up sail. In
about an hour, however, the wind dropped, and the men had to take to their paddles.
We had a nice view of the coast just after sunrise, and we also saw Kina Balu very
distinctly. We had changeable winds all day, but managed to reach Gaya Bay about five
o&#x2019;clock; and, as wind and current were now against us, and the men were tired with
paddling most of the day, we went ashore on one of the islands to cook, and resolved
to remain here all night, or until a favourable breeze sprang up, which we might expect
at any time after sunset. Here, as at Pulo Tiga, the beach is sandy, and is fringed
with tall casuarina trees, through which the winds sigh as mournfully as they do through
the leaves of a pine forest here at home.
</p>
<p>The broad-leaved pandan (<i lang="la">Pandanus dubius</i>) is common here, having a tall, cylindrical trunk, like a cocoa-nut palm, and bearing
a branched crown of dark-green leaves. Here also we could obtain plenty of nebong
tops; and on waste patches, near the shore, <i lang="la">Tacca pinnatifida</i> grew abundantly<span class="corr" id="xd29e2753" title="Not in source">.</span> This plant is interesting, as affording a kind of starch, much used as food by the
South Sea Islanders, but not valued here, where rice is plentiful. Here we found plenty
of the large blue pigeon; and although they were very wild, we managed to shoot two
or three; and these, with the fresh palm-tops, were a great gain to our culinary department.
</p>
<p><i>August 4th.</i>&#x2014;Again a beautiful sunrise. We pulled from under the lee of the island about six o&#x2019;clock,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247">247</a>]</span>stood out on our course, with a slight breeze. Off the mouth of the Menkabong river
we came upon a tiny fleet of native boats, the owners of which were fishing with hook
and line. We found out that they were some of Pangeran Rau&#x2019;s people, a chief who holds
the country around Qualla Menkabong, and at whose house I had stayed on a former journey
into the interior. We were glad to purchase some freshly-caught fish from these people,
which we afterwards enjoyed for breakfast. Fried in a little pure oil, and sprinkled
with a little oatmeal, they were very nice. Palm-tops boiled formed a delicate vegetable
accompaniment to them.
</p>
<p>We are five days out to-day; and as our bread, which we of course brought with us,
is beginning to turn mouldy, my &#x201c;boy&#x201d; has dipped each of the remaining little loaves
in water, and is busy baking it afresh on a tin plate over the embers. Treated in
this way, our old bread is really very nice; indeed, not a bad substitute for hot
rolls.
</p>
<p>One of our men had a line out astern all the morning as usual, but never perceived
a nibble until about 1.30 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, when there was a sudden commotion, owing to his being nearly jerked out of the boat
by a large fish, which had taken his bait. The fish was fairly hooked, but the men
had a good deal of trouble to haul him in. He was a splendid capture, fully fifty
pounds or more in weight; and it took two men all their time to lift him into the
boat, even after a spear had been driven through him. We all admired him very much
as he lay on deck; indeed, half a hundred weight of good fresh fish would be welcome
anywhere. It was of a variety, called &#x201c;Linko&#x201d; by the Malays, and in general appearance
reminded one of a fine salmon.
</p>
<p>A little later in the day another kind, about half the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248">248</a>]</span>size of the last, was caught, this being called &#x201c;Tingerie.&#x201d; We reached the mouth of
the Abai about 5.30 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, and tried hard to make the mouth of the Tampassuk ere dark, in which we failed;
and after being tossed about for an hour in vainly endeavouring to get over the bar,
our men were glad to pull back to a little island, near Qualla Abai, where we could
land to cook, and anchor for the night. It was a lovely, moonlight night, and very
quiet in our snug little anchorage. We dined and slept on board, and so escaped the
myriads of mosquitoes on the grassy shore.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">August 5th.</span>&#x2014;Awoke at sunrise, the air being deliriously fresh and cool, and the sky clear. We
were glad to get a very good view of Kina Balu this morning, the long rocky ridge
standing out first purple, and then blue, against the sky, while fleecy masses of
silvery clouds were ever changing their position on its rugged sides.
</p>
<p>After a delicious bath in a little fresh-water pool near the shore, and breakfast,
we pulled to the Qualla Tampassuk, and found a strong current coming over the bar.
Our men pulled over, however, all right; and then came a good five hours&#x2019; pull up
the river before we reached the old quarters of Rajah Muda, now occupied by Mr. Pretyman,
who had come to live here a month or two ago, and for whom we had brought on the mails
from Labuan. The whole distance from the bar is only about five miles; but the river
winds much: and, as it was the wet season, a deal of water coming from the ranges
inland had swelled the river beyond its usual limits, and the men had to pull against
a heavy stream.
</p>
<p>The vegetation of the banks is luxuriant; and after pulling a mile or two, native
dwellings, and cultivated patches of bananas, cocoa-nut trees, tapioca, maize, and
other products appear. We reached Mr. Pretyman&#x2019;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249">249</a>]</span>residence about 1.30 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, and found him and his people tolerably well in health and spirits. He was surprised
and pleased at our unexpected visit, and promptly ordered his men to kill a fine young
bullock for ourselves and men. After luncheon we crossed the river and walked to the
top of the adjacent coast-hills, from whence a good view of the winding stream and
surrounding country is obtainable. These bare grassy hills rise out of the plain,
which serves as pasturage for a few buffaloes, and here and there patches are irrigated
for rice culture. I made a small collection of the herbaceous plants, annuals, and
grasses of the hill we ascended; and on the top we found a round-headed tree, which
bore edible fruits, remarkably like walnuts in form and flavour.
</p>
<p>In descending, we came across plants of a very lovely gardenia, forming bushes, varying
from a foot to two feet in height, and bearing large white flowers in the axils of
its glossy leaves. A gentle spring-like shower was falling in the last rays of sunlight,
and the perfume of this dainty flower was most balmy and delicious, quite unlike the
odour of any other plant I ever saw. On my return from the mountain I was careful
to secure plants of this species, and they reached London quite safely three months
afterwards. As it was now dusk we returned to dinner, and spent a very pleasant evening,
talking over home news, and our plans for reaching Kina Balu.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">August 6th.</span>&#x2014;We were up at sunrise and set to work in packing our stores into suitable parcels
for each man to carry, and we hired two buffaloes so as to be able to carry an extra
supply of rice. These details took time, and it was fully noon ere we bade our host
farewell and were fairly started on our journey. Our guide and buffalo <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250">250</a>]</span>driver was an intelligent Malay, named Abdul Rathman, who knew the country well. Our
first stopping place was to have been Ghinambaur, but as we were late in starting
we failed to reach that village before dark, and had to stay at some Dusun huts by
the way. At first our way lay through the plain, and here the roads, or rather tracks,
through the tall coarse grass were frequently knee deep in mud and water; then we
crossed some low hills of red sandstone which were nearly destitute of herbage, owing
to the earth being washed off the rock by heavy rains. In places the tracks over these
hills were more like drains than anything, and during a heavy shower the water rushes
down these water-worn runnels carrying every atom of soil or pulverised rock into
the plains below, so that these last consist of a rich alluvial deposit, well adapted
for rice and tapioca culture.
</p>

<p class="first"><i>To face page 250.</i></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>On the second range of these low hills is a Badjow village, most of the houses being
much exposed, without a tree or any kind of shelter. The rain came down in torrents
as we passed this place, and some of our Labuan men took shelter from the cold rain
and wind which was indeed very piercing. We had to cross some rice fields, in one
of which a man was ploughing. The plough was of wood, shaped something like an old
English plough in the beam, but with only one handle, and no coulter, wheel, or share-board.
This was drawn by a solitary water buffalo, and rooted up the greasy black earth to
a depth of five or six inches. At one side of the field we saw a rude harrow formed
of bamboo stems lashed together, the side shoots being cut at about six inches from
the stem, and these act as prongs to scarify the soil. The whole system of land culture
here is very rude, and yet it is far in advance of that practised by natives anywhere
else in Borneo, if we except the plain near the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251">251</a>]</span>banks of the Tawaran river, a few miles further to the south. Passing the last group
of Badjow houses we came to the river again and found it running rather high, the
water being much discoloured by the earthy matter washed down from the hills during
rains. This was the beginning of difficulties, for we had to unload the buffaloes
in order to prevent our rice from being wetted, and then we rode them across, while
the men carried the packages on their heads, and held on by the saddle-gear or tails
of the animals. After piloting across one detachment in this way we returned for the
others, and so managed to get all the men over safely, and keep the goods dry. Our
road got worse and worse, now through tall coarse grasses which, arching overhead,
nearly excluded daylight, then through bits of forest where one&#x2019;s face was in danger
from overhanging boughs and creepers, crossing dirty streamlets, and clambering over
roots and stones, while in places the path suddenly dropped downwards into a sort
of slimy trough or drain, the sides of which were as high as the saddle, and down
which one&#x2019;s buffalo slided rather than walked. Of course we were drenched to the skin,
and our clothes, which were nice and white at starting, were covered with mud, but
there was nothing for it but to keep on, which we did until nightfall, when, finding
it impossible to reach the village of Ghinambaur, we &#x201c;put up&#x201d; at some field huts,
and in the absence of mosquitoes, passed a comfortable night on the floor of one of
the huts warmed by a cheerful wood fire.
</p>
<p><i>August 7th.</i>&#x2014;Arose at 5 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> and took breakfast. We had simmered a piece of beef in a pot over the fire all night
with onions, two or three chilies, a bit of fresh ginger, and just a handful of rice
for thickening, and the result was a very palatable soup; boiled beef and biscuit
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252">252</a>]</span>completed our meal. We &#x201c;squared up&#x201d; with our landlord by paying a fathom of grey shirting
and two black Chinese looking-glasses for our house (which we had all to ourselves),
firewood, and a nice young fowl for our dinner. About six o&#x2019;clock I mounted my steed,
and a ride of about two hours brought us to the luxuriant fruit groves which surround
Ghinambaur. We found a scattered village close beside the river, each house having
its own clump of <span class="corr" id="xd29e2810" title="Source: cocoanut">cocoa-nut</span> and other fruit trees. A mottled-leaved alpinia was common beside our route, and
a pretty climbing plant with opposite leaves, each bearing a thunbergia-like white
flower, was not unfrequently observed among the grass and low shrubs. A rynchospermum
and two species of mussænda were very conspicuous. One of the last-named was a bushy
plant two to four feet in height, bearing bright orange-scarlet flowers among its
dark glossy foliage, each flower being set off by a pure white bract nearly as large
as one&#x2019;s hand. As seen among the grass this plant was very distinct and effective.
Its congener is a climbing species not nearly so showy.
</p>
<p>We rested in a Dusun house for an hour awaiting our stragglers, two of whom were sick.
Whilst waiting we spread out our rice to dry, as it had become damp, doubtless owing
to the drenching rain of yesterday. Our hostess was a rather attractive Dusun girl,
whose husband was away on a hunting excursion. She was very obliging, and seemed quite
pleased at our visit. The house was small but very neat and clean, having, moreover,
an air of comfort about it not often seen in Dusun dwellings. Among other goods we
noticed netting needles of wood, similar in principle to our own, together with excellent
fishing nets, weaving instruments, by means of which a strong and durable cloth is
made from the macerated fibre of a species of curculigo called &#x201c;lamba&#x201d; by the natives.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253">253</a>]</span>This is afterwards dyed with native grown indigo. Water bottles of bamboo, sieves
and fans of different kinds used in cleaning rice, well made baskets of rattan-cane,
knives and choppers were also represented, and we especially noted an excellent adze
lashed to its shaft by neat rattan work. This implement is used in cutting and trimming
planks from the large forest trees, saws being unknown here. I noticed a small basket
of true cotton of excellent staple, but it is not much used, &#x201c;lamba&#x201d; fibre being obtainable
in any quantity from the jungle without any trouble, and its fibre is more readily
worked with the help of rude implements. For sewing thread we found our hostess using
the fibre of pine-apple leaves (<i lang="la">Ananassa sativa</i>), which serves the purpose well. This plant must have been introduced to Borneo many
years ago, for it has become thoroughly naturalised, apparently wild, indeed, and
not even jungle fires seem able to destroy it. In the Philippine Islands the plant
is common, although the dainty manufactures of &#x201c;pina&#x201d; fibre formerly made there are
now to a great extent discontinued. As examples of skilful handweaving, these &#x201c;pina&#x201d;
fabrics are even superior to the celebrated hats of Panama, and a dress made in the
best manner would cost from a hundred to three hundred guineas.
</p>
<p>The villagers who accompanied the &#x201c;Orang Kaya,&#x201d; or headman, on his visit to us a short
time after our arrival, were very much interested in our firearms, and begged of me
to &#x201c;shoot something.&#x201d; To please them, I took a chance shot with a Snider rifle belonging
to Smith, and brought down a couple of cocoa-nuts which hung on a tree about one hundred
yards off. There was a general rush to pick up the fallen nuts, and the blackened
place where the ball had struck was examined with much astonishment.
</p>
<p>We now marshalled our followers and again made a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254">254</a>]</span>start on our way. We found the roads awfully wet and slippery, and in about half an
hour&#x2019;s time it rained in torrents, and the river being now so swollen and turbulent
that there was no hope of our being able to cross it to-day we had to pull up at a
little village called Buramhangan. The house where we stayed was about one hundred
feet above the river, which we could hear rushing and roaring all night. We were soon
surrounded by the villagers, most of them young people, and remarkably handsome. The
men, especially, had very regular features, dark expressive eyes, and their jet black
hair when free from the loose coil in which it is generally worn hung down as low
as the waist in lustrous masses which a woman might envy. They appeared to be very
thrifty, and had abundance of poultry, swine, and buffaloes. Their manufactures seem
to be cloth, baskets, hats, and mats of various kinds, together with fishing nets
(made in exactly the same manner as our own), and household utensils of bamboo and
cocoanut shells.
</p>
<p><i>August 8th.</i>&#x2014;We awoke just before sunrise. A lovely morning, and the river has fallen much during
the night. We tried to hire another buffalo from these people, but as they would not
come to terms quickly we had to push on without it, having fully made up our minds
to reach the village of Sineroup ere nightfall. Our path lay up the hill for about
half a mile, and then we bore down hill to the left. The path was like a drain, and
awfully dirty. Smith&#x2019;s buffalo made a bit of a start, and its girths being loose he
and the baggage toppled over into the long grass and brushwood beside the path. A
little further on I had the same luck, although fortunately for the rice and sleeping-gear
which my beast carried it happened in a dry place. The roads were very bad, and also
the fords, but we plodded steadily onwards, and by four <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255">255</a>]</span>o&#x2019;clock <span class="sc">P.M.</span> we climbed the hill and were safe at Sineroup. The last ford but one was rather turbulent,
and our men being a long way behind we did not wait for them, and they did not get
in until night-fall. We stayed here in the headman&#x2019;s house, and found him a jolly
fellow with a striking Chinese physiognomy and vivacious manner. He and his family
gave us a hearty welcome, spread mats for us on a little raised platform near the
window, and gave us a fowl and some rice, so that we had satisfied our hunger before
our men arrived.
</p>
<p>We were now fairly into the country of the &#x201c;Dusun,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Piasau Id&#x2019;an,&#x201d; the meaning
of this last literally being &#x201c;Cocoanut Villagers.&#x201d; Generally they are a clean-skinned
and handsome race, far superior to their neighbours the &#x201c;Muruts,&#x201d; who live farther
south, and whose land-culture is but indifferent. So far as I could learn, polygamy
is not practised by these aboriginals, and they always appear contented and happy.
The dwellings which, near the coast, are generally of &#x201c;atap,&#x201d; or thatch made from
the leaves of the &#x201c;nipa&#x201d; palm (<i lang="la">Nipa fruticans</i>), are here nearly entirely of bamboo, the roof being thatched with &#x201c;atap&#x201d; of cocoanut
or the sago palm. Here at Sineroup the headman has a very clean and convenient bamboo-house,
and a good deal of wealth in the shape of brass gongs, large ornamental water-jars,
cooking pots of brass and earthenware, finely worked mats, &amp;c., while half a dozen
sturdy buffaloes are contentedly grazing on the green below the house. Of pigs, poultry,
and domesticated bees, he has plenty. I had placed my dirty boots outside the house
on a little verandah, and during the night they were either knocked down by visitors
or else fell through below the house. When I asked my boy for them in the morning,
we found that the pigs had eaten up all but the soles. Luckily I had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256">256</a>]</span>others, or the loss would have been one of the worst that could have befallen me,
since in all long foot journeys, and especially in mountain climbing, good boots are
of the first importance.
</p>
<p>In the tarippe trees (<i lang="la">Artocarpus Blumei</i>) here, we noticed very ingenious traps of bamboo, set to catch the &#x201c;basing,&#x201d; a sort
of squirrel or tree-climbing rodent, which plays havoc with this delicious fruit just
as it approaches maturity. At this village our guide thus far, Abdul Rathman, is to
return, so we have engaged the headman here, &#x201c;Gantang,&#x201d; to accompany us on our next
two days&#x2019; journey as far as Kiau, which is the last village on the way to the mountain.
The scarcity of birds and animals is very marked as we proceed inland. One reason
for this may possibly be the absence of virgin forest, nearly all the country bordering
on the Tampassuk river having been by some means&#x2014;possibly former cultivation, aided
by jungle fires&#x2014;stripped of all its primæval forest.
</p>
<p><i>August 9th.</i>&#x2014;We were up at daybreak, and at once ate our breakfast. As usual, we had to await
the coming of our guides, and it was fully nine o&#x2019;clock ere we got fairly started.
I notice that many of the natives here wear semi-circular betel-boxes tied around
them, and charms are very commonly worn. These last are seemingly of the most varied
description, anything seems to do for a charm&#x2014;shells, teeth, and bones of animals,
seeds, stones, and bits of rock, tiny bells, and especially a kind of fossil wood
called &#x201c;kayu lagundi,&#x201d; or, &#x201c;tree of youth.&#x201d; These are enclosed in the folds of an
old kerchief and are tied around the body. Great confidence is felt by the wearers
of certain good charms, and they are very popular among the Sulu pirates, who will
fight like demons, believing themselves to be invulnerable. All the villagers had
come down to see us start, and they followed us down <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257">257</a>]</span>to the river, which is not far from the houses. Rain during the night had caused the
current to run strong and high, and none of our men dare venture across. We had a
rope for such emergencies, and my interpreter, a lusty Badjow, named Suong, swam across
and tied it fast to a tree. It was now easy for our men to cross, and we all got over
safely. A little higher up we had to recross again, but the current here was stronger,
and all the goods had to be carried across by our Dusun followers, who had accompanied
&#x201c;Gantang,&#x201d; the headman of Sineroup. Fortunately nobody was drowned, but the time occupied
in crossing was so long and we were all so tired with our exertions that we were glad
to stay at a wayside village instead of going on to Kambatuan as we had desired. We
saw a good many attractive plants to-day, but unfortunately the dangerous difficulties
of our journey left us but little time for collecting. And yet, although hungry and
fatigued to a degree which no one can imagine who has not travelled in a tropical
land without roads or bridges, one could but feel enthusiasm as ferns of filmy beauty,
orchids of curious structure and vivid colours, graceful glumales, flowering shrubs
and palms, met our eager eyes for the first time.
</p>
<p>One of my first &#x201c;finds&#x201d; this morning was a singular bolbophyllum, which grew on the
branch of a tree over a stream, and which, as I had from the first suspected, has
turned out to be &#x201c;quite new.&#x201d; It has been named, in gratitude to the Hon. P. Leys,
<abbr title="Bachelor of Medicine">M.B.</abbr>, Colonial Surgeon of Labuan, <i lang="la">B. Leysianum</i>, Rchb. f. Its structure is so very extraordinary that nothing but an engraving could
give any adequate idea of its characteristics. A creamy flowered dendrobium (<i lang="la">D. cerinum</i>, Rchb. f.), grew on trees here and there, bearing its flowers in clusters, and a
dwarf cymbidium (<i lang="la">C. Spinksianum</i>, Rchb. f.), was also met with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258">258</a>]</span>in bloom, as also was a white-blossomed ixora, bearing pendulous compound clusters
of fragrant blossoms. A curious strong-growing vanilla draped trees in most places,
and on some wet mossy rocks beside a rushing torrent, a glossy-leaved phalænopsis
(<i lang="la">P. luteola</i>) displayed its golden blossoms, each sepal and petal mottled with cinnabar. C&#x153;logynes
were everywhere abundant on trees and rocks alike, and on the latter overhanging the
streams hung masses of a waxy-leaved æschynanthus, bearing axillary clusters of crimson,
black-striped flowers, each standing erect from a gracefully modelled purple chalice.
Ferns and mosses hung on the dripping river rocks in glorious profusion. Numerous,
indeed, were fair Flora&#x2019;s temptations to lingering dalliance on our way, but we had
an ulterior object in this journey which nothing must interfere with. Our mission
was to push onward, letting nothing hinder our march&#x2014;difficulties and inclinations
must alike be conquered if we would that our journey be crowned with success!
</p>
<p>Kambatuan reached, wet and fagged, we were glad of a change of clothing, preceded
by a brisk rub with a dry towel, ere we thought of food. Our guides had selected a
roomy house, and we soon had a cheerful wood fire ablaze on the hearth, which, as
is usual here, was in the centre of the large public apartment occupied by ourselves
and our retainers. A fowl and some eggs were soon purchased, and our whilom host was
very hospitable, having spread some nicely-worked mats near the fire, and instructed
his daughters to make cigarettes for us, which, with the kindness which clings to
their sex all the world over, they, seeing that we were strangers, wet and tired,
were nothing loth to do. These cigarettes, under the native name of &#x201c;rokos,&#x201d; were
always forthcoming, and are made of tobacco (segope), both <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259">259</a>]</span>grown and manufactured by these inland people. It is cut very neatly, and is made
up for sale into ropes or rolls a yard or more in length, these being folded so as
to make convenient bundles about nine inches long. Although not given to trickery,
it is customary for these people to make the rope &#x201c;core&#x201d; of refuse tobacco, or of
the leaves of kaladi, or other plants, and over this the really good manufactured
tobacco is wound. The result of this is that the useable produce is not above one-fourth
of the apparent bulk, and although all are well aware of the subterfuge, and carefully
examine every roll of this tobacco before they purchase it, yet the practice continues
year after year. For smoking, this dark shaggy tobacco is carefully unwound from the
&#x201c;core&#x201d; (or &#x201c;prot,&#x201d; literally stomach), and enfolded in a neat wrapper formed of the
young leaf of the nipa palm, or occasionally in the thin husk of the maize cobs, both
of which serve the purpose of cigarette paper by burning slowly but freely, producing
neither flame nor flavour. There is scarcely a more national trait observable among
Borneans than the smoking of the &#x201c;roko.&#x201d; It is the one luxury common to all. From
the Sultan to his meanest subject&#x2014;male or female&#x2014;everyone indulges in smoking them;
indeed I have repeatedly seen unweaned infants partaking of the solace of the breast
and of their tiny &#x201c;rokos&#x201d; alternately, both the gift of indulgent Bornean mammas.
</p>
<p><i>August 10th.</i>&#x2014;All night we could hear the rain pouring down in torrents, but it cleared up towards
morning, and at sunrise all was beautifully clear and bright. This is the view we
obtained of the mountain as seen this morning at 7 a.m., all the lower part being
obscured by the trees in the foreground. By 7.30 we had breakfasted, and were on our
way. Yesterday had been a most unfortunate day so far as real progress towards the
mountain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260">260</a>]</span>was concerned, and although all our guides were loud in their protests that it would
be impossible to cross the streams after the late heavy rain, we were doggedly determined
to go on. We crossed the river twice, and now, at 8.30, all further progress seems
impossible, since we have to cross again, and this at a place where the river is a
boiling torrent nearly five feet deep. The Dusun themselves seem to have no great
difficulty in crossing, but our Labuan men are afraid. The great difficulty is to
keep one&#x2019;s legs under one in the strong current, and to facilitate this being done
the Dusun often take up a heavy stone and carry it on one shoulder. Our men bathed
here whilst waiting, and most of them took up a stone and cast it into the water ere
they flung themselves in. This they do to propitiate the &#x201c;antu,&#x201d; or river god, who
they tell me might otherwise be offended, and afflict them with sickness. As we sit
beside this rushing river, the most gorgeous butterflies flit here in the chequered
shade afforded by overhanging branches. Yellow, white, and brown species vie with
each other in activity. Now and then the most splendid ornithoptera are seen, their
strong and swift flight resembling that of a bird. One lovely fellow, fully six inches
across the wings, settled on my boot as I remained motionless watching it. It was
of a velvety blackness, with a bold band of pea-green across the wings. Another species
rather smaller has a band of metallic blue. These delicate insects are generally most
numerous by rivers, or in sunny places by the dry beds of streams, and, singularly
enough, are most abundant during the cool wet monsoon.
</p>
<p><i>August 11th.</i>&#x2014;A lovely morning, and at sunrise we obtained charming views of &#x201c;Kina Balu.&#x201d; The rugged
top crags were especially well defined, as also the sloping plateau, which seemingly
forms the watershed for one of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261">261</a>]</span>the highest falls. Apparently we are quite near to the mountain, and the waterfall
is distinctly audible, which does much to increase the delusion. As the sun&#x2019;s power
increased, however, the view lost its distinctness, and in half an hour&#x2019;s time heavy
white mist clouds had swept around its summit, and all its beauty of tint and shadow
was lost to view. We ate a hurried breakfast, and started for Koung, a large and prosperous
village situated a little to the south-east of Saduc-Saduc, the mountain ascended
by Mr. Thomas Lobb in 1856. Our way lay diagonally down a hillside drain until we
came to the river, which we forded, and then bore to the left across level rice-fields
and patches of luxuriant kaladi (<i lang="la">Caladium esculentum</i>) and Indian corn, both of which evidently succeed best on these rich low lying alluvial
plains. We crossed the river four or five times ere we at last found ourselves on
the splendid village green of Koung. This green is a mile or more in length, lying
at the foot of a range of sandstone hills which shelter it from the north, while the
river skirts its southern side, and another hill rises from the river banks still
further southward. It is, in fact, a well watered grassy plain between two sheltering
parallel hill ranges, and affords the best pasturage for cattle that I have seen anywhere
in the East. Of this the villagers take every advantage, for nowhere have I seen finer
kine and buffaloes than here. We reached the headman&#x2019;s house at Koung about four o&#x2019;clock
in a drenching downpour of rain. Some trees beside the stream were draped with a glorious
climber, having scarlet flowers (<i lang="la">Bauhinia <span class="corr" id="xd29e2890" title="Source: Kochiana">kochiana</span></i>), and a glaucous climbing plant, having lilac flowers, had completely overrun some
of the forest trees on the opposite bank. We took up our quarters in the house of
the headman, &#x201c;Lapayang,&#x201d; to whom Mr. Veitch and myself had given a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262">262</a>]</span>Tower musket on the last journey I made in this direction. I notice that such of my
men as speak the Brunei language can converse with the Dusun very readily after a
few days&#x2019; residence amongst them. This fact was noted by Mr. St. John, and from what
I know of the language myself after a year&#x2019;s residence, and aided by vocabularies
carefully collected, I believe the language of these people is intermediate between
that spoken in the capital, Brunei, and that of the Sulus. Bees-wax and caoutchouc
or rubber are frequently offered for barter as we pass through the villages. &#x201c;Lapayang&#x201d;
welcomed us in his own way by firing a salute, and a gong was beaten to announce our
arrival. I was sorry to find that his father had died since my last visit, when he
had received us with many expressions of good-will, and told us of Mr. Low&#x2019;s first
visit to the mountain, which he remembered well. As we had arrived before our supplies,
&#x201c;Lapayang&#x201d; brought us some rice and a fowl as a present, and one of his sisters gave
us some eggs and a fine cluster of bananas. I felt thankful when we arrived at Koung,
since I knew the way from this place to the mountain quite well, and had not to trust
to lazy guides, who have not the slightest idea of time or its value to the traveller.
My buffalo also had reason to be glad, for here the plucky little beast had the luxury
of good herbage on which to feed, a much better thing for him than the miscellaneous
browsing afforded by our former halting places. The river runs about fifty yards from
our quarters, and is very much swollen, having in many places overflowed its banks.
Capital shooting may be had here at the large blue pigeons which roost in the trees
beside the river, quite close to the houses.

</p>
<p><i>August 12th.</i>&#x2014;Again a lovely morning as we crossed the ford just at the end of the village and
pushed on for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263">263</a>]</span>Kiau. The road lies by the sides of the river most of the way until the turn to the
left is taken up the open rice-fields, which lie below the last-named village. We
crossed this river thirteen times to-day, and some of the crossings were deep and
rapid. Met troops of natives&#x2014;male and female&#x2014;mostly laden with large baskets of tobacco,
which they were taking down to the villages nearer the coast to barter for cloth,
knives, and other goods, as no traders appear to venture further inland than the first
Dusun villages. Most of the men were armed with a long slender-shafted spear, which
is especially useful to them in fording the streams. In addition they had the &#x201c;parang,&#x201d;
a sort of scimetar-shaped sword, having a good keen edge. This is slung to a broad
belt worn sash-wise over one shoulder, the part which crosses the breast being ornamented
with cowrie shells sewn on very thickly. I was very glad when we reached the little
farms of the Kiau villagers, and could see their dwellings and palm-trees in the distance.
In some of the clearings the crimson-leaved dracæna (<i lang="la">D. terminalis</i>) was conspicuous. It has here slender stems five or six feet in height, each terminated
by a tuft of bright coloured leaves. Going up the hill slowly, I made a little collection
of the weeds found among the rice and kaladi crops. Among these were two pretty little
plants of the daisy family (<i lang="la">Compositæ</i>), the one with purple and the other with yellow florets. A tiny species of torenia
formed spreading tufts of purplish leaves and stems, and bore rather pretty purple
and white flowers. A woolly-leaved gnaphalium attaining a foot in height, and bearing
dense clusters of yellow immortelle-like flowers, was especially noticeable. There
are numerous springs of cool water, clear as crystal, in this hillside, and these
are brought down to the path in tiny troughs or aqueducts of bamboo, so that one has
only to stoop very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264">264</a>]</span>slightly to drink, and water-vessels are readily replenished. The whole hillside is
dotted with flat-roofed field-huts of clean yellow bamboo. These afford shelter during
the mid-day siesta enjoyed by the workers in the field, who are for the most part
women and children. Tiny streamlets are met with now and then, and in favourable spots
the most graceful tree-ferns of the primæval jungle still linger, although fully exposed
to the hot sun. The lower parts of their black trunks, however, are shaded by coarse
herbage, and their roots revel among the earth, <i lang="fr">débris</i>, and wet stones below. In some places the wet earth and stones beside these streams
were carpeted with lovely mosses, and of these several rare kinds in good condition
were obtained. We met one of my old guides, &#x201c;Kurow&#x201d; (see p. 97), this morning as we
came along. He came up to me laughing and vociferating loudly. &#x201c;Soung,&#x201d; who interprets
Dusun for me, says that he wants me to understand that he, &#x201c;Kurow,&#x201d; is glad to see
me again, and that he will do all he can to help me. We reached the village about
three o&#x2019;clock in a dense white mist, and it commenced raining heavily a few minutes
after our arrival. Among the plants we saw to-day was a splendid large bolbophyllum
(<i lang="la">B. <span class="corr" id="xd29e2918" title="Source: Petreianum">petreianum</span></i>). A vanda grew on the trees overhanging the river, but was not in bloom. The deliciously-perfumed
snow-white flowers of <i lang="la">Dendrobium crumenatum</i>, which were especially beautiful on the immense boulders of granite on the green
at Koung, was also often met with to-day, and at one of the fords a large-growing
c&#x153;logyne (<i lang="la">C. racemosa</i>) bore drooping spikes of yellow and white flowers, the entire inflorescence being
nearly a yard in length. While my boy was cooking dinner I made sketches of the most
peculiar plants of botanical interest met with <i>en route</i>, much to the surprise&#x2014;I might almost say awe&#x2014;of the natives, who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265">265</a>]</span>crowded around me and watched every line&#x2014;and especially the colouring&#x2014;with great interest.
I was surprised at the small number of women who came to see us in comparison with
those who flocked into the house when we were last here. I found, however, that this
was owing to their being away engaged in rice planting and other field labour. The
headman of this village, named &#x201c;Lemoung,&#x201d; had died since my last visit, and we saw
his grave on the little hill just as we entered the village. A little hut had been
erected over it, and this was decorated with eight little streamers of white cloth.
His son, &#x201c;Boloung,&#x201d; now &#x201c;reigns in his stead.&#x201d; When we took our evening meal most
of the women had returned from work, and the house was crowded, and the greatest curiosity
was evinced as our plates, knives, forks, and glasses were spread out glitteringly
in the lamplight. These people are very different from the Malays of the coast, and
never tired of laughing and talking about ourselves and our goods. The women are not
in the least secluded, and are far better proportioned, as well as more amiable and
industrious, than are their Malayan sisters. Their clothes consist of a &#x201c;sarong,&#x201d;
or short petticoat, fastened around the waist, and reaching to the knees, and a strip
of black cloth is bound over the breast. Their ornaments consist of brass wristlets
and anklets. Necklets of beads or brass wire are also worn, and over the breasts,
as also around the waist, coils of rattan cane dyed black or red are worn. Ferrule-like
pieces of tin are often strung on these rattan coils, and strings of beads are also
worn around the waist. Ear ornaments are generally of wood, and as large as a wine-cork.
Both men and women have holes pierced in their ears, but these are not unfrequently
utilised as cigarette-holders, much in the same way as the Zulu Kaffirs at the Cape
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266">266</a>]</span>carry snuff-boxes in their ears. Everywhere here inland we find the native cloth is
made from the &#x201c;lamba&#x201d; fibre dyed a deep blue-black with native indigo. I procured
specimens of this fibre-weaving apparatus, and prepared cloth, and these may now be
seen in the large Economic Museum at Kew. After dinner &#x201c;Kurow,&#x201d; our old guide, and
&#x201c;Boloung,&#x201d; the headman of this village, came in with the avowed purpose of having
a chat. They were particularly anxious to hear about the white man who had come to
live on the Tampassuk river (Mr. Pretyman), who they had been told intended to make
them all pay tribute, which was evidently unpleasant news to them. They also wanted
to know where I had been since I left their village, and were very much interested
in all I told them about the Sultan of Sulu. The house was full of people of all ages,
who had come to see us, and among them were a party from a village three days&#x2019; journey
inland. These were on their way to the coast villages to trade. The produce they had
with them was tobacco, bees-wax, india-rubber, and a little &#x201c;lamba&#x201d; cloth and raw
cotton. These people had never seen a white man before, and seemed rather interested
in all we did; and in the accounts their Dusun neighbours gave them of us and our
doings, the gist of which was that we came from a large prahu, or ship, to dig up
grass and shoot birds, that we ate and drank all sorts of curious things, but singularly
enough, as they thought, would not eat rats or tiger-cats, these being esteemed great
delicacies here by the native trappers. Here, at Kiau, as at all the Dusun villages
along our way, we noticed large quantities of tame or domesticated bees. These are
kept in cylindrical hives formed of a hollow tree trunk, and are placed on a shelf
fixed under the overhanging eaves of the houses. In several instances the hives were
on shelves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267">267</a>]</span>inside the houses, a hole being made through the &#x201c;ataps&#x201d; corresponding with the hole
in the hive, so as to allow of egress and ingress, a plan similar to that adopted
by the bee-keeping natives of Kashmir.
</p>
<p><i>August 13th.</i>&#x2014;I and Smith have been busy all morning, overhauling our stores and goods, and getting
ready for our going up the mountain to-morrow. Our rice had suffered from damp, but
as we find we can buy some here, it does not matter so much. Several fowls were also
brought in for sale this morning, so that we are not likely to starve. Having put
all our gear into order after our seven days&#x2019; march, we took our guns and a couple
of men, and took the path leading eastward, which led us across one or two rice and
vegetable plots, in which tobacco plants were growing freely, and at last we crossed
a recent clearing and reached the forest, which crests the spur or hill range on which
the village of Kiau stands. We turned northwards and climbed the hillside, which was
stiff work, being in places nearly perpendicular. Here I found a pretty foliage plant,
having strap-shaped leaves six inches in length, glossy green, boldly variegated with
silver-white above, while the underside of the leaves was of a deep blood colour.
Of this I gathered as much as I desired, and a wild plantain or banana growing near,
I cut one down, and packing my plants close together in damp moss and earth, I enveloped
them in the cool moist sheathing layers of the banana stem. Thus packed, they occupy
but little space, and are easily carried without risk of damage by drought or friction.
Saw several c&#x153;logynes in flower on the surrounding trees, but other orchids seemed
scarce. I made a collection of ferns, mosses, &amp;c., for drying, but nothing striking
from a horticultural point of view was seen. We gained the crest of the ridge after
an hour&#x2019;s hard work, and followed it eastward for two or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268">268</a>]</span>three miles, but without any change in the vegetation. On returning, we did not descend
the way we came, but followed the crest in a westward direction, and from one point
we got a capital view of one of the waterfalls on the mountain. It was now becoming
misty, however, and we returned to the village, which we reached just in time to avoid
a drenching, for the rain came down in torrents. I sent one of my men to fetch &#x201c;Kurow,&#x201d;
and when he came I told him I wanted to bargain with him to take me to the mountain
in the morning. He at first said he couldn&#x2019;t bargain, because &#x201c;Boloung,&#x201d; the headman,
was out. He had scarcely spoken, however, before &#x201c;Boloung&#x201d; himself entered from the
other end of the house. Finding this loophole closed, he said he could not bargain
to-day, because it was an unlucky day to him. He had visited all his traps and snares
this morning, he said, and there was nothing caught, adding that he knew it before
he started; this was his bad day. &#x201c;Boloung&#x201d; said they would come in and bargain in
the morning. Fortunately I was not entirely dependent on them, and could have found
the way myself, intricate as it is. Anyone who had not travelled here before, however,
is entirely dependent on these people as guides, and their utter disregard of the
value of time is perplexing enough to a stranger with limited supplies of food for
himself and followers. It was these people who turned back Mr. Thomas Lobb when he
attempted to ascend Kina Balu from this village in 1856, and the moral force of a
well-armed and rather imposing party is still necessary in order to keep their avarice
within moderate bounds, and to obtain from them the little assistance necessary. When
Mr. Low ascended the mountain in 1851, he gave many presents to these people, and
even now the wealth the village obtained through his visit is much talked of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269">269</a>]</span>among the hill villagers. When Mr. Lobb was there, five years later, he had but a
small party of followers, and not being prepared to pay in cloth and other goods so
liberally as Mr. Low had done, they refused to help him, and he was compelled to leave
without ascending the mountain, as he had desired to do. Even in 1858 Mr. Low and
Mr. S. St. John had to &#x201c;guard carefully against pilferers,&#x201d; and had a little hostility
to contend with as well. On their second expedition, in the same year, however, they
experienced a better reception. Some years later, I believe in 1866, an Italian expedition
came here for natural history purposes, and the Dusun account is that they ascended
6,000 feet. This expedition, according to native accounts, paid twice as much as was
necessary, a precedent which gives these hill villagers an excuse for extortion. When
I and Mr. Peter Veitch came here, eight months ago, we had a well-armed force at our
backs, and we taught the Kiau people how to moderate their desires by paying a just
price for all they gave or sold to us, and for all services performed, but we gave
no presents. Livingstone<a class="noteref" id="xd29e2943src" href="#xd29e2943">1</a> deprecates the system of giving presents in his first work on travel, and he is not
the only traveller who has had reason to complain of a mode of procedure which invariably
causes inconvenience to others. These people were always well-disposed towards us,
and this time I find our plan was a good one, for there is no misunderstanding; fowls,
rice, and other provisions are far more easily procurable now, since the natives know
that all will be fairly paid for, whereas under the old system their object was to
give a small present in the hope of receiving something far more valuable.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270">270</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>August 14th.</i>&#x2014;&#x201c;Kurow&#x201d; came in this morning, and commenced to &#x201c;bargain&#x201d; cautiously by asking to
see the goods we were willing to pay for guides. &#x201c;Suong,&#x201d; our interpreter, who was
an adept at trading, spread out some cloth and other things to the value of a few
shillings, and after a deal of talking an agreement was arrived at by &#x201c;Kurow&#x201d; and
&#x201c;Boloung&#x201d; consenting to accompany us in return for these things and an old coat of
mine, upon which &#x201c;Kurow&#x201d; had cast longing eyes ever since my arrival. Among the goods
was an entire length&#x2014;twenty-six yards&#x2014;of grey shirting, and this was brought back
for me to divide into two halves, each of these dusky chiefs seeming firmly convinced
that the other would &#x201c;best&#x201d; him if possible. Having, after some slight trouble, divided
the cloth to their liking, and handed them the other goods in pre-payment, another
difficulty arose, both declaring that they could not start to the mountain to-day,
as they had no rice, and must needs go to the next village to obtain some. By this
time all my men were ready to start, and as I had said I should set out to-day, I
was determined to do so at all risks. I explained to them that they had plenty of
rice in their village, but that if they really wanted more &#x201c;Kurow&#x201d; had better accompany
us, and &#x201c;Boloung&#x201d; could obtain supplies and come on after us on the morrow, adding
that we should start at once, and if their agreement was not kept we should of course
take back the goods we had pre-paid them. It must be distinctly understood that in
Borneo pre-payment for goods or services to be rendered is the national custom, just
as it is in South America. In the latter country the natives who collect the india-rubber
or caoutchouc in Brazil may serve as an illustration of the fact. I left my &#x201c;boy,&#x201d;
who was rather unwell, and the only old man in our party, to &#x201c;abide by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271">271</a>]</span>the stuff&#x201d; in the house, and shouldered my gun and left our guides to think matters
over. We had not proceeded above a mile, however, before &#x201c;Kurow&#x201d; overtook us, and
went on ahead as cheerful as possible. After an hour or two of rough walking on shelving
forest-paths, varied here and there by slippery logs, we came to a mountain-stream,
probably one of the tributaries of the Haya-Haya. Here, in a large stone trap, the
worthy &#x201c;Kurow&#x201d; was fortunate enough to find a large wild cat. I had not spoken to
him since he overtook us, but I could not resist the opportunity of reminding him
that this was one of his lucky days! We crossed here, the water being deliciously
fresh and cool, and another hour&#x2019;s stiff walking brought us over the base of the next
spur, and to our old quarters, the &#x201c;Sleeping Rock,&#x201d; where we were to rest for the
night. This is a gigantic overhanging boulder near a foaming torrent. A pretty little
maidenhair fern, before alluded to, grew here in great plenty, and attained the greatest
luxuriance among the <i>débris</i> of former camp fires. Overhead a colony of mason bees had established themselves,
forming multitudes of little rounded mud nests on the face of the rock, and when we
lighted our fires the smoke disturbed them much. A still greater nuisance, however,
was our guide, &#x201c;Kurow,&#x201d; who made a fire and commenced to cook his wild cat by roasting
it, hair, skin and all, without the slightest preparation. When Mr. Veitch and myself
slept here during my first visit, he had two rats&#x2014;rather high they were too&#x2014;which
he roasted entire, and ate with great satisfaction! The soil near the bottom of these
immense spurs is very rich, as attested by the luxuriance of bamboo and species of
ginger which are comparatively puny on poor land. Beside the mountain torrents a pink-spathed
aroid (<i lang="la">Gamogyne Burbidgei</i>, N.&nbsp;E. Br.) is common, and rather <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272">272</a>]</span>pretty. A species of dwarf palm (<i lang="la">Areca, sp.</i>), bearing clusters of small scarlet fruits, is noticeable, and a trailing plant,
allied to the jasmines, bore axillary clusters of white waxy flowers, each having
a brown eye-like spot in its centre. The perfume emitted by its blossoms was delicious,
and resembled that of spring hyacinths. A red-fruited raspberry (<i lang="la">Rubus rosæfolius</i>), and several species of ferns and selaginellas carpeted the low shady forest along
our route. The only bird we saw was a lyre-tailed shrike of a dark ash colour. Our
dinner consisted of a fowl cut up and boiled with a little rice, and when it was nearly
done we added a small tin of Julienne soup to it, thus securing some substantial potage,
and we were hungry enough to appreciate it at its full value. A cup of coffee and
a cigar made us forget all our bruises, and knowing the stiff day&#x2019;s work we had for
the morrow, we retired to our blankets early.
</p>
<p><i>August 15th.</i>&#x2014;We awoke about 5 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> and aroused our followers. A Malay named &#x201c;Jeludin,&#x201d; acted as cook in the absence
of my regular &#x201c;boy,&#x201d; and he prepared a very palatable breakfast of the remains of
our dinner, supplemented by nicely boiled rice and dried fish. &#x201c;Kurow&#x201d; breakfasted
off wild cat roasted <i>à la</i> Dusun, and a little rice which we gave him. After breakfast he sat smoking, and &#x201c;Suong&#x201d;
came and told me that he would not go up the mountain. On my asking him his reason
for resolving thus, he replied that he could not go because he had no trowsers, nor
coat, nor head-cloth. I had given him a warm tweed coat previous to starting, but
this he had left in his house. I at once told him through &#x201c;Suong,&#x201d; that if he did
not go as I had paid him to do, I should tell all the headmen as we returned to the
coast, that he broke his bargains, and was afraid to go up the mountain. This threat
had the desired <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273">273</a>]</span>effect on him; for after reflecting on it several minutes, he arose and prepared to
start, saying with charming <i>naïveté</i>, that &#x201c;I was a good man, and that he liked me.&#x201d; About seven o&#x2019;clock &#x201c;Boloung&#x201d; and
five or six of his followers rejoined us, as they had promised, and we set off on
our way up the spur.
</p>
<p>Our path at first lay up the bed of the torrent, but we left this in a few minutes,
bearing up the spur to the right, past a bamboo fence in which rat-traps were placed
at intervals of a few feet. Here and there, too, we noticed the dangerous spring pig-spearing
apparatus, so commonly met with in the forests of the Murut and Kayan tribes who live
further south. The deposit of forest <i>débris</i> at the base of this south spur is very rich in ferns and herbaceous plants. A melastomad
here and there bore clusters of pretty pink flowers. Of this plant, which grew in
the moss beside the path, there are green and purple-leaved varieties. A glossy-leaved
ardisia, having clusters of red berries, the foliage being claret-coloured beneath,
was conspicuous; and the stems of a shrub four feet high were covered with clusters
of vermilion-tinted berries the size of small peas; another shrub, a yard high, having
lance-shaped serrate leaves, bore clusters of pure white, gesnera-like flowers. As
we climbed higher up the mountain side, rhododendra, bearing white, scarlet, yellow,
or magenta-coloured blossoms, began to appear, and epiphytal and terrestrial orchids
also became more plentiful. The curious pitcher-plants also increased in profusion,
some being of a wondrous size and of the most singular form, colour and texture. At
one place in a secluded mossy nook, where Mr. Veitch and I had obtained plants during
our last ascent, I found that some cuttings we had accidentally left on the ground
had thrown out numerous fresh roots into <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274">274</a>]</span>the wet moss on which they lay! The delicately perfumed little orchid, <i lang="la">Dendrochilum glumaceum</i>, was flowering freely, its elegantly drooping inflorescence resembling the most dainty
filagree work. Golden and white-flowered c&#x153;logynes nestled here and there beside our
path. In one place, the curious little <i lang="la">Rhododendron ericifolium</i> was in bloom; and another species, growing on mossy trunks, bore waxy, bell-shaped
flowers of a clear orange-scarlet colour. The dark glossy green <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275">275</a>]</span>foliage of this last reminded one of that of a sciadopitys in form, being linear,
and arranged in whorls. It has been named (<i lang="la">Rhododendron stenophyllum</i>, Hook. f.).
</p>

</div><p>
</p>
<p>As we ascended the temperature fell faster and faster, and at intervals we were completely
enveloped in dense clouds of mist, while at other times they were dispersed, and the
sun brightened up the mountain side. One place we passed this morning is rather dangerous,
almost like walking on the ridge of a high building, the descent on one side however
being a sheer precipice of 1,500 feet, and the other side is steep; but there are
a few bushes near, which give one confidence. At 8,000 feet we again enter a dripping
cloud, or rather it sweeps down to meet us, and the trees here are of low stature
and gnarled, the branches being so low that in places one has to crawl through them.
Casuarina trees are commonly met with. The ground and lower bushes are covered with
wet mosses, and white hair-like masses of usnea sway to and fro in the higher branches.
The cold increased, and my Labuan men felt it very much. I looked at my thermometer
at three o&#x2019;clock during a heavy shower, and at an altitude of 9,000 feet, and it registered
56°. In England one would consider this a delicious temperature; but when we started
this morning we had a temperature thirty degrees higher.
</p>
<p>It was curious to notice the effect the depression of heat and the rain had on my
men, who had never in their lives known the thermometer below 70°. They appeared perfectly
paralysed; and the Dusun themselves were but little better. We reached our former
camping-place, the cave, about 3.30, wet, cold, tired, and hungry. Five of the fellows
were so far chilled and exhausted that they gave up when within ten minutes of the
cave, and huddled themselves close together under <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276">276</a>]</span>some dry rocks. I sent twice for them to come on to us, but they would not move, and
passed the night without fire or food, rather than bestir themselves to prepare either.
We managed to start a fire after some difficulty, and then pulled off our cold wet
garments. I got one of my Malays to rub me briskly all over with a coarse towel, and
then put on two flannel shirts, trowsers, and jacket, after which I felt comparatively
comfortable. One of the Dusun fetched us some water from a stream half a mile off;
and it was so icy cold as to make one&#x2019;s teeth chatter to drink it&#x2014;rather a novelty
in the tropics.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Jeludin,&#x201d; although shivering, set about cooking our dinner; and &#x201c;Suong,&#x201d; who was
the most useful man I had, chopped up enough wood to last us all the night. The men
who came on with us sat shivering under the rocks for over an hour, before I could
induce them to set about lighting themselves a fire. It was, indeed, really painful
to see the poor fellows so utterly paralysed. &#x201c;Boloung,&#x201d; the chief of the Kiau Dusun,
who had accompanied us, had carried up a fowl under his arm the whole way; and when
he reached the cave, I was agreeably surprised when he presented it to me, and I took
it as a great compliment, for it is extremely rare for a Dusun to put himself to so
much trouble even for a friend, much less for a stranger like myself. This fowl, although
lively enough in the morning, had become so wet and cold during the ascent, that it
appeared to be dead; indeed, I thought it was dead for some time, but on holding it
near the fire, it revived a little. Our Dusun followers made their encampment under
a dry, overhanging rock, a quarter of a mile ahead of us. We had a view of the great
waterfall on the bare granite rocks of the mountain opposite, and could hear the dash
of its current into the stream below very plainly.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277">277</a>]</span></p>
<p>After dinner we made up a good fire; and never did I fancy a cup of hot coffee so
delicious as this seemed to be; while the primest of fragrant Havannahs have been
far less comforting than was the modest cigarette of native grown tobacco, which one
of my followers made and presented to me on the spot. Our fire blazed up brightly,
and diffused both warmth and fragrance in our rocky dwelling; and, wrapping our rugs
and blankets around us, we were soon asleep, surrounded by our Labuan men, who crowded
around the fire, and kept it replenished with fuel throughout the night.

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>August 16th.</i>&#x2014;We were up by daybreak; and while &#x201c;Jeludin&#x201d; was preparing breakfast, I went out with
the men collecting such plants as I wanted, and packing them in the native sago-sheath
baskets (granjombs) with which we had provided ourselves. I was anxious to begin thus
early, as I wanted to start most of the men back to Kiau to-day. After three or four
hours&#x2019; hard work, we loaded twelve men and started them off on the downward journey;
and as we intended staying two days longer up the mountain, they had orders to collect
other plants which I had pointed out to them near Kiau. After starting them off, I
was glad to take breakfast before exploring further for other things which I much
wished to procure. After our repast I started off over the ridge of the spur, progress,
however, being very slow, as nearly all the way one had to climb through branches,
roots, or low shrubs. A glossy-leaved begonia, with large white flowers, was common
beside the streams, and three species of c&#x153;logyne were met with growing among the
rocks and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279">279</a>]</span>bushes. A great many small-flowered orchids of various genera were seen, but few were
in bloom. Dacrydium, phyllocladus, and a peculiar casuarina of drooping habit were
seen, and several herbaceous plants, among which I noted a drosera and a species of
dianella, much resembling those of Australia. Among ferns were at least two species
of trichomanes, two or three gleichenias, a peculiar form of dipteris resembling <i lang="la">D. Horsfieldii</i>, but dwarfer and quite glaucous, nearly white indeed below, and a strong-growing
blechnum. Several mosses in fruit were gathered, and most of them were either absolutely
new, or had not been discovered in Borneo before. Here and there I came across patches
of an acre or two in extent of rocky mountain side without any tree-growth. These
rocky patches were carpeted with coarse sedges, among which the great <i lang="la">Nepenthes Rajah</i> grew luxuriantly, an enormous crimson-tinted pitcher depending from each of its large
lower leaves. These gigantic urns were for the most part filled with rain-water, among
which were the remains of ants, beetles, and other insect-life. Nearly all the pitchers
were found resting on the surface of the earth, and in most cases they were hidden
by the overhanging leaves, sedges, and <i>débris</i> among which the plants grow. It was, in the case of the younger specimens&#x2014;plants
a foot high or so&#x2014;that the pitchers were most evident and luxuriant. Seedlings of
this size were even more ornamental than their big jug-bearing brethren. Here and
there were specimens of <i lang="la">N. Rajah</i>, great clumps having stems five or six feet in height, with very broad massive leaves,
and pitchers capable of holding two or three pints of water. It is these large plants
which flower most freely, some of the stems bearing three or four spikes of their
rich maroon-tinted blossoms, around which two or three kinds of flies or gnats were
playing in the sunshine. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280">280</a>]</span>The female plants were not nearly so plentiful as were the males, and I am inclined
to think that these tiny flies aid fertilisation, for some of the female plants were
a long way distant from any males, and yet they appeared to have been fertilised.
<i lang="la">N. villosa</i> is often found in these open patches with the larger kind just alluded to, but more
frequently it affects the margins of the open patches, and luxuriates among the low
bushes, by which its weaker and more elongated stems are supported. <i lang="la">N. Lowii</i> and the beautiful <i lang="la">N. Edwardsiana</i> appear never to reach so high an altitude as those just named. I cannot describe
the elated emotions I felt in traversing this mountain side, and gazing on forms of
vegetable life the most remarkable of any to be found in the whole world! Hunger,
bruises, and the repeated drenchings we had received during our journey hither, these
and all other of our troubles seemed to vanish as I gazed around me on the wonders
of creation and inhaled the cool invigorating mountain air. We returned to our cave-dwelling
about four o&#x2019;clock. As I write up my diary, a tiny bird is flitting about quite close
to me, and does not appear in the least afraid. It is but little larger than a wren,
its body being of a dark brown colour; the head and shoulders are mottled with yellowish
brown. From its lively and erratic flight, I suspect it is of the flycatcher group.
It flits backwards and forwards from bough to bough, and frequently leaves a branch
as though flying right off, and quite surprises you by suddenly and adroitly twisting
itself round and dropping back into the place from which it started. Another occasional
visitor is a blackbird, having a golden bill and a reddish-brown breast. It strongly
resembles our own blackbird indeed, but is perhaps a trifle fuller in the body. Again,
we heard the little songster alluded to in the account of my first visit <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281">281</a>]</span>here. I know of no bird whose melody <span class="corr" id="xd29e3049" title="Source: possesess">possesses</span> the ravishing sweetness and variety of melody of this one, its song in the early
morning being especially delightful. Were it possible to introduce it, this little
stranger would be a most welcome addition to our domesticated song-birds here at home.
Space is limited here in this cave, and one has to sit pretty close to the fire. Just
after dinner to-night, as I sat making notes in my pocket-book, Smith, in lifting
our extemporised kettle off the fire, let it fall, and the boiling water fell over
my feet. My boots were off, and the pain was rather hard to bear. &#x201c;Suong,&#x201d; who is
equal to all emergencies, recommends me to put some wet salt on the scalded portions
of my feet, which, to please him, I did, and the pain soon after abated. I was very
sorry for this accident, being afraid it would prevent my extending my excursions
up the mountain side to-morrow, as I had arranged to do. It is raining very heavily,
and Smith reminds me that we have only had two wholly fine days since leaving Labuan.
</p>
<p><i>August 17th.</i>&#x2014;Our cave had become drier, owing to the fire we had constantly kept burning, and
we slept well last night. One of our men, on going to his basket this morning, found
a rat in it, which he at once secured and killed. It had doubtless been tempted by
the warmth and his little store of food. It resembled very nearly the long-tailed
grey Norway species, now so common in England, and was quite distinct from the short-tailed,
long-snouted kind, of which &#x201c;Kurow&#x201d; had trapped two specimens during our first visit
here. When our Dusun guides came in, one of them quickly appropriated it as a desirable
addition to his edible stores. Our own breakfast this morning was of oatmeal porridge
(a nice change from constantly eating rice) and tea and biscuit. I had some difficulty
in putting my boots on, owing to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282">282</a>]</span>scalding my feet received last night. My feet were very painful at first, but getting
warm with walking, they did not inconvenience me so much as I had expected. We had
a long walk up the mountain side to-day searching for seeds and plants. The highest
height we reached was 10,700 feet, but it must be pointed out that our object was
to collect all the plants and seeds we could in the richest vegetable zone on the
mountain, and not to reach the summit. Had our object been to ascend to the top nothing
would have prevented our doing so; indeed, the real difficulties of climbing &#x201c;Kina
Balu&#x201d; are very few, and not worth mentioning; indeed, we found our journey to its
base from the coast far more exacting to our strength and temper. We were fortunate
in our search to-day, having, after a long and disappointing search yesterday, failed
to obtain the particular plants and seeds I was anxious to obtain. To-day, however,
I was rewarded by finding a few in good condition. We returned to our cave at about
four o&#x2019;clock, and found our Dusun followers, who had been in another direction, had
also brought me in a nice lot of seeds, plants, and flowers. They had complained of
the cold nights on the mountain, and threatened to leave us this morning (as indeed
they did last journey), but I promised them some rice for their evening meal, and
eventually they had consented to stay another night. Before dinner we packed up our
plants and seeds carefully, and arranged everything ready for our descent in the morning.
I wished to start early, so as to have plenty of time for collecting on our way, as
at one spot I much wished to make a <i>détour</i> to collect seeds. Our bird visitors came around us to-day again, and fearlessly came
quite close to pick up the crumbs of rice we threw towards them. We have had rain
more or less for two whole days, and it was bitterly cold towards eight <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283">283</a>]</span>o&#x2019;clock, when we wrapped our rugs around us to retire for the night. My thermometer
stood at 45° just outside the cave, and during the night it had descended to 38°.
I awoke during the night quite stiff with cold, although I lay close to a good fire.
My rugs had slipped from my shoulders, and I was glad to fold them tightly around
me, and to put more fuel on the fire. It was a lovely moonlight night, the light being
so strong on the branches opposite our cave as to make them look as if covered with
snow. Mr. St. John mentions having seen a sort of hoar-frost here during one of his
journeys. The great fall looked like a silver streak down the rocky mountain side
opposite, and the rush of its waters into the chasm below comes quite clearly through
the night air.
</p>
<p><i>August 18th.</i>&#x2014;While Jeludin boiled the water for our coffee this morning, I carved my initials
on the soft red sandstone wall of our cave, and then clambered up a tree just opposite
to try and get a better view. All is mist and cloud below us except seaward, where
a strip of the coast line and the rivers towards Menkabong and Gaya are visible. I
can see the great fall very plainly coming down the face of the rock opposite, just
where it disappears into the wooded gully, below there is a magnificent grove of tree
ferns, and as I am fully a thousand feet above them, I can look down on their expanded
clusters of fresh green fronds, and the effect in the morning sunlight is past all
description. About 7.30 a.m. we started on our downward journey, at first climbing
the ridge through roots and branches which were notched here and there for foothold.
On reaching the path above, a few minutes&#x2019; walk brings us to a series of great steps
and an open space or two covered with jutting rocks and boulders, sedges, low bushes,
and the great pitcher-plants. Here we made a short stay collecting, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284">284</a>]</span>much to the disgust of our Dusun guides, who pointed to the dark clouds and told us
we should have rain, and much wished us to push onwards. Lower down still we came
across plants of the beautiful <i lang="la">Nepenthes Edwardsiana</i>, scrambling up bushes and casuarina trees to a height of twenty or thirty feet. Both
this species, and also the curious <i lang="la">N. Lowii</i>, are frequently perfectly epiphytal, all the old stems and roots originally in the
ground being dead, but the top growth has rooted into the wet moss and <i>débris</i> which rests on the trees and bushes everywhere around. Of the first-named there are
two distinct varieties, differing in the length and form of their pitchers. <i lang="la">N. Lowii</i> is first seen at about 5,000 feet, and is one of the most singular of the whole group,
its urns being flagon-shaped, and of a hard leather-like consistence. Growing quite
plentifully beside the path were tiny plants bearing tripetalous flowers of a white
or pink tint, and very pretty. In some places it was quite bushy in habit and a foot
in height, being literally covered with blossoms. Some large mosses, one of them having
stems a foot in height, were also gathered, and a few inconspicuous orchids, epiphytal
and otherwise, were observed in bloom. A plumose filmy fern (<i lang="la">Trichomanes, sp.?</i>) depended here and there from the half rotten casuarina branches overhead.
</p>
<p>Owing to the rain yesterday our descent was far from pleasant, and falls were not
infrequent, in fact on both occasions I have found descending this mountain very troublesome
and dangerous owing to the wretched paths one has to follow. I carried a sago sheath
basket behind me, fitted with bark straps for the shoulders, and it was lucky I did
so, for I had one or two nasty falls <span class="corr" id="xd29e3083" title="Source: backward">backwards</span>, and it saved my head more than once from contact with the slippery stones. Our guides
have at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285">285</a>]</span>last gone on a-head quite disgusted at my stopping here and there to take up a plant
or gather seeds, which I can never resist doing. My boots had given way like brown
paper owing to their being constantly wet, and I had to tie them on my feet with strips
of bark. My feet had chafed where scalded, and were now very painful, while the constant
strain on the legs during the slippery descent was very exhausting. However after
many falls backwards and forwards we reached Kiau about four o&#x2019;clock p.m. thoroughly
tired and hungry. I felt thankful when I regained the hill above the village where
all the hard work is over. I had tired out the patience first of our guides, then
of my Labuan men, and even Smith had at last left me lingering collecting roots and
specimens, and so I was the last man of our party to reach the village. As I descended
the hill three of my men met me and took my load of plants, for I had both arms full
besides the basket at my back. Tired and wet as I was I could not resist the impulse
to look at the plants my men had brought down two days before, and I was glad to find
that they were fresh and healthy. A mist swept around us soon after I got inside the
house, and the steady rain we had experienced all the afternoon changed to a regular
downpour. I was glad to put on my dry clothes after a thorough good wash and rub down
with a towel warmed at the fire. I found that the skin was off my feet in great patches,
and they swelled very much after removing my boots. Smith had a large sore on his
heel, and he agreed with me that our ascent was child&#x2019;s play compared with the descent.
</p>
<p>My &#x201c;boy&#x201d; had cooked us some rice and had bought us some fine ripe tarippe fruit to
eat with it. We afterwards had a cup of nice warm chocolate each, and lighting our
cigarettes, our fatigue and bruised shins were soon forgotten, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286">286</a>]</span>as we nestled cosily in our warm rugs in the glow of a sweet wood fire. After our
return crowds of people flocked in to see us, and the house resembled a <span class="corr" id="xd29e3092" title="Source: market place">market-place</span>, fowls, rice, sweet potatoes, maize cobs, rattan hats, tobacco, wax, caoutchouc,
and Dusun gourd-organs of bamboo being among the produce and manufactures offered.
The men squat down in groups, and there is a great deal of talking about the mountain
and &#x201c;Tuan Hillow&#x201d; (Mr. Low), and &#x201c;Tuan Bunga,&#x201d; the name by which I am known to these
people as well as to the Malays of the coast. It is quite a gala night, and the young
girls are full of questions about the mountain. My men &#x201c;Suong&#x201d; and &#x201c;Jeludin&#x201d; told
me that the cave on the mountain was a good place to sleep in, as there were no spirits
there, adding that on the island at Gaya, and also at Pulo-Tiga they had been afraid
to sleep, as the spirits were so many there! By the first stream we crossed to-day
in descending the mountain, a pretty pink-flowered impatiens was flowering freely,
and on the wet rocks we noticed a tuft of red-berried nertera. On a dripping wet rock
here also a very fine trichomanes luxuriates, forming large mat-like masses of black
roots, and long finely-cut filmy fronds. Two boys brought in a quantity of anæctochili
to-night soon after our arrival, and asked for needles in exchange, which we gladly
gave them. The talking and laughter of the natives, who seemed quite pleased at our
safe return, lasted until I fell asleep about eight o&#x2019;clock, how much later I do not
know. Previous to this I called &#x201c;Suong,&#x201d; and bade him tell all the villagers assembled
that I intended leaving in the morning, so as to give time for my men to prepare their
things, and that the natives, knowing our intentions, might bring in any fowls or
rice they wished to sell early ere our departure.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287">287</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>August 19th.</i>&#x2014;First thing this morning I heard that our buffalo, which had been turned loose to
graze on the green here, is missing. All the men went to seek it while we ate our
breakfast. &#x201c;Kurow&#x201d; had so often tried to induce me to exchange this animal&#x2014;a female&#x2014;for
a male of his own that I was for a time suspicious of his having stolen it during
the night. We had intended to start for Koung to-day, but the loss of our buffalo
will detain us, as we cannot well leave without it, partly on account of its use to
me now that my feet are raw and tender, and partly because it will not do to allow
a theft to pass unpunished. A Dusun woman brought in a basket of fresh ginger roots
this morning, which I find is cultivated by these people. Several fowls and some rice
were also brought in, and these my &#x201c;boy&#x201d; bought in exchange for our old biscuit tins
and glass bottles. During our forced delay I walked out to take a last look at the
village, and to make a few sketches and notes. In the little flat-topped hut, which
served as a head-house, I found a pile of about fifty skulls in one corner, some being
in a basket suspended on the wall. These, the villagers tell me, are the skulls of
their old enemies, and their individuality seemed well known to one old man, who pointed
out several to me as having once rested on the shoulders of some of the Chinese settlers,
who, some few years ago, disappeared from this Dusun country altogether, although
their peculiar physiognomy still lingers among the Dusun tribes into which they married,
so that it is just possible that they became absorbed into the native tribes. Others
were pointed out as the heads of their old foes the Lanun, whom the Dusun people detest,
say that they formerly came up to the hills with the ostensible purpose of trading,
but adding, that they really wanted to steal their children as slaves. I offered &#x201c;Boloung&#x201d;
a good Tower <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288">288</a>]</span>musket for a couple of these heads, but so highly are they still valued by these people
that he refused to part with them, even for so high a price. This custom of head-hunting
may be said to have died out amongst the Dusun, since they failed to subsist by hunting,
and have taken to the less exciting employment of land culture. One place was pointed
out to me where thirty men and their chief had been slaughtered together and their
heads taken, only a few years ago. This was at a ford near Sineroup, and a rude circle
of stones still marks the spot where the bodies were interred; all the stones are
single except that which represents the chief, which has a smaller stone on its apex.
I find the custom of marking burial places with erect stones very common among these
people. On returning to the house I find that &#x201c;Kurus,&#x201d; one of my men, a shock-haired
Bruneian, has brought in my buffalo, having tracked it through the soft mud to a bit
of jungle at some distance from the village, and there he found him tied to a tree!
</p>
<p>The large house in which we stayed is big enough to accommodate five or six families,
and the large common room, which extends from end to end, will hold twenty or thirty
men and their baggage quite comfortably, having three or four hearth-stones for fires
at intervals. It stands on a grassy knoll just at the entrance to the village, and
the group of pinang and cocoa-nut palms on the lower side give to it quite a picturesque
appearance. All over this district tree-ferns are very beautiful, especially so in
the valleys and glades which exist up among these cool hills. Every now and then the
traveller comes upon whole groves of them, and solitary groups exist even in the cultivated
ground. So sweetly fresh and green are they, and quite distinct in form and tint from
all surrounding vegetation, indeed, these feathery tree-ferns, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289">289</a>]</span>and the tall clustering wands of bamboo, form the most distinctive features of the
landscape. We at length bade our friends good-bye, and the whole village came to the
knoll above the stream to see us start, and the girls were especially interested and
begged of us to come again and bring them some needles, looking-glasses, and cloth.
</p>
<p>Coming down the <span class="corr" id="xd29e3107" title="Source: hillside">hill-side</span> cornfields from Kiau I saw here and there patches of cotton (<i lang="la">Gossypium barbadense</i>), and a delicate pink-flowered variety of tobacco was in bloom, and being supported
by stakes, were perhaps left for seed. On the steep side of the opposite hill are
numerous little farms, and on each you see a tiny flat-topped bamboo-hut which is
used for shelter and rest during field labour. The soil is a reddish friable loam,
thickly sprinkled with large sandstone boulders and stones; while in the lower plains
and valleys is a deep black deposit which under irrigation yields splendid crops of
rice. Under European protection and management, aided by systematic Chinese coolie
labour, the virgin tracts on these hill ranges might be worked with advantage in the
production of coffee and cinchona. Once fairly started, and with improved roads, this
district would possess many attractions, not the least being a comparatively cool
and salubrious climate. At elevations of 3,000 to 5,000 feet a cool bracing air is
readily obtainable, indeed, as suggested by Mr. Low, the Marie Parie spur would form
a capital site for a sanatorium of the utmost value to Europeans. At higher elevations
a really cool climate, almost European, in fact, is obtainable. To bring this fertile
district into cultivation and to form anything like good roads, however, would be
a task Herculean, and one only to be accomplished by an immense expenditure of labour
and capital. The system employed by the natives in clearing their new farms is to
fell the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290">290</a>]</span>trees and then to burn them during the dry season. The old stumps are left, and to
prevent the rich earth and forest <i>débris</i> from being washed away by heavy rains, logs are laid against these horizontally all
down the steep shoulders of the spurs. Land newly cleared yields splendid crops of
hill or dry rice, maize, kaladi, tobacco, sweet potato, and other crops. There is
very little primitive forest on these lower hill ranges and spurs, nearly all the
land not now actually under culture being fallow, in the shape of low jungle. The
only really virgin forest is the tops of the hills beyond Kiau and the spurs of Kina
Balu itself on the south and east sides. On our way to Koung to-day we had a lot of
trouble owing to the swollen and rapid state of the river, which we crossed no less
than thirteen times. All along our way we saw little torrents of muddy water pouring
into the river from the hill-sides. The two last times we had to cross the stream
previous to our reaching the regular ford at the entrance to Koung village were really
very dangerous, and I shudder when I think of the surging torrents we crossed, and
of the large treacherous boulders, water-worn and as smooth as ice, which lay hidden
in their beds.
</p>
<p>I rode my buffalo: Smith walked and clung to the ropes which held the saddle. The
banks of the stream were overflowed so that we could not tell exactly the proper place
to cross. My buffalo was a brave and careful animal, and must have been possessed
of immense power, seeing how she carried me and dragged poor Smith over safely. I
shall never forget our last crossing. We had missed the proper place to ford without
our knowing it. The place we had chosen to cross was, as we afterwards found, a succession
of smooth boulders and deep holes. The buffalo had to feel its way, and when in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291">291</a>]</span>mid-stream, unluckily, set its feet on a boulder. Splash we went, all over together,
into a deep hole. Ugh! how I did shiver as I sank to my neck with the buffalo submerged
beneath me. As we rose again I glanced around and thought for a moment poor Smith
had gone. In a moment, however, he rose to the surface of the stream, where he lay
extended grasping the ropes of the saddle with one hand at arm&#x2019;s-length, and gasping
for breath. All the time we were being carried down stream, and bravely as the plucky
buffalo struggled her feet continually slipped on the loose pebbles below. &#x201c;Hold on,
Smith!&#x201d; I gasped, as splash we all went over another gigantic boulder, and the water
surged up to my ears although on the back of the beast. I clung like a sailor in a
gale. Fortunately for us the buffalo regained her footing, and clearing the current
by a great effort she carried me and dragged poor old Smith up the bank Koung-wards.
&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a narrow squeak, old boy,&#x201d; I said, but Smith was too exhausted to answer as
he tottered and staggered to a seat on a stone lying near. I also was glad to rest,
and although thankful for our merciful escape, I could scarcely look sober as I glanced
at Smith, who was as white as a ghost, and staggered like a drunken man.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said he, when he had recovered his breath, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s all very well laughing, but
you don&#x2019;t catch me crossing in that way again.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>And in justice to his veracity I must own that I never did, for he avoided me and
the beast at crossings ever afterwards. Arriving at the ford at Koung a young Dusun
came and assisted Smith over, the water being very high and rising every minute. He
then recrossed and led over my buffalo, who a few minutes afterwards once more regained
her liberty on the green, while we, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292">292</a>]</span>usual, took up our quarters with &#x201c;Lapayang&#x201d; in his bamboo-house. He and his people
were surprised at our having got across the river to-day, and pointed to where it
was rushing and foaming a yard higher than its usual current. Smith lost his stick
and some plants he was carrying for me, and his rifle, too, would have gone had it
not been strapped to his back. No one can possibly understand the danger of these
swollen torrents who has not had personal experience of them. Once off one&#x2019;s feet
in the surging stream, running seven or eight miles an hour at the least, one&#x2019;s life
would inevitably be dashed away on the boulders and jagged rocks which occur every
few yards. Adventures of this kind look tame when calmly written down after all danger
is past, and when read by a comfortable fireside, but they are really very real and
exciting when one is undergoing them in person. A little later we were surprised by
&#x201c;Suong&#x201d; and my &#x201c;boy,&#x201d; poor little &#x201c;Kimjeck,&#x201d; who came in looking as miserable as drowned
rats. They had avoided the dangerous fords by coming along the hill-path beside the
river, but my other fellows refused to come on, and took shelter from the rain in
some Dusun huts midway.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Lapayang&#x201d; received us kindly, as usual, and gave us a fowl and some rice, and lent
us some cooking pots. Another villager brought us eggs and a cluster of fine golden
bananas&#x2014;I never tasted more delicious ones&#x2014;so that we dined well after all our mishaps.
After dinner our host brought us in a couple of fine large tarippe fruit, just at
a time when dessert was least expected; we deserved it, however, and enjoyed it accordingly.
I think I never felt so fatigued before in my life, my feet and legs were sore, and
the exertion of the descent yesterday, and the falls I had, made me ache all over.
Added to this, my skin from head to foot was covered with irritable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293">293</a>]</span>red eruptions, caused by a minute red parasite of acaroid nature, which my men told
me came off the buffalo on which I had ridden. As we sat smoking after dinner we heard
the rain falling very heavily, and it lasted most of the night. The troubles of the
day are ended, and we have cause to be grateful for our preservation from its dangers.
</p>
<p><i>August 20th.</i>&#x2014;It was at first very wet this morning, but an hour after sunrise it cleared up and
the sun shone beautifully. Our laggards came in about eight o&#x2019;clock, just as we finished
our breakfast of fowl and rice. There are plenty of fine cocoanut trees here, and
one can obtain fine fruit. &#x201c;Kurow&#x201d; overtook us here this morning, having, together
with his little daughter and another girl, walked from Kiau since daybreak. They are
going on to Kambatuan, he tells me, to trade, and the girls have baskets of tobacco
on their backs. We bought some cocoanuts and paid our host &#x201c;Lapayang.&#x201d; He particularly
wanted some powder and caps for his musket, and these we gave him, together with a
handkerchief or two, and looking-glasses for his sisters, two fine girls, both married
to young men of the village.
</p>
<p>We started for Kambatuan after all our men had arrived, and &#x201c;Kurow&#x201d; accompanied us.
Altogether we had a day&#x2019;s rough work, two of the crossings being shoulder high and
very rapid, so that only I and the buffalo could cross, and the men and Smith had
to follow the windings of the river a much longer distance over rough ground, for
the most part covered with coarse grasses and jungle. It rained heavily at intervals,
and we did not reach the foot of Kambatuan hill much before dusk; and after half an
hour&#x2019;s climbing up a path like a drain, sometimes stony, sometimes of slippery yellow
clay, we reached the village in a regular downpour. Nowhere else in Borneo <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294">294</a>]</span>have I seen such groves of &#x201c;tarippe&#x201d; trees as surround this village. When we last
visited &#x201c;Kina Balu&#x201d; in December, &#x201c;langsat&#x201d; fruit was in season, and met with at nearly
all the Tawaran villages. Now, in August, the &#x201c;tarippe,&#x201d; rich and luscious, is most
abundant, and now and then a coarse brown fruit, something like a horse-mango, is
obtained, and is agreeable for a change. The perfume of the ripe &#x201c;tarippe&#x201d; fruit was
most cheering to ourselves and our men, and almost as soon as we had got off our wet
garments, and put on dry ones, a dusky maiden appeared with four large fruit in her
plump little arms. She was dressed <i lang="fr">à la mode</i> Dusun, and had wire wristlets, and a heavy wire anklet an inch thick, which must
have weighed two or three pounds, around her left leg. A younger child brought us
some fine plump bananas, which we found to be rich and luscious as new honey, leaving
an aroma in the mouth like that produced by ripe filberts and old dry port.
</p>
<p>We had a large concourse of the villagers in to see us this evening after dinner,
including &#x201c;Beuhan,&#x201d; the headman, who wears a head-cloth and kriss, and in general
build and physiognomy resembles the Sulus much more than either Dusun or Malays. &#x201c;Kurow&#x201d;
was the principal talker, and related all that we had done and how much he had helped
us in ascending the mountain. The young girls crowded to see us, and tried hard to
get speech with us. We had given the girls who brought us fruit a looking-glass each,
and we could quite well understand that all were eager for a similar gift. They were
very, very scantily clad; indeed the most tolerant of Lord Chamberlains might well
wish to add an inch or two to their tiny petticoat, especially as &#x2019;tis the only garment
of which they can boast. It answers somewhat to the American definition of a dress
&#x201c;which began too late and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295">295</a>]</span>left off too soon.&#x201d; Here, however, it is the customary fashion, and as such is honoured.
How graceful were the figures of some of these young girls! Perfect little Amazons,
lithe of limb and having regular features, eyes full of gentle expression, and a richness
of raven hair most European ladies might envy. It is pleasant to know that these dusky
girls, lovely as some of them are, will never be degraded to anything worse than field
labour, which is a far better lot than that of their Malayan sisters along the coast,
whose personal charms chance to be interesting. We found out later on in the evening
that the pretty damsel who had first brought us fruit was the headman&#x2019;s daughter,
&#x201c;Sa&#x2019; Tira&#x201d; by name. Most of the evening she knelt by the fire, her dainty little fingers
busily making cigarettes for her papa&#x2019;s guests, many of whom had arrived from other
villages near to look at us. Altogether we spent a very pleasant evening with these
hospitable people, and we have no doubt but that they will long look back to our visit
themselves, seeing that whole months frequently elapse without their seeing anyone
from the coast even, much less a white man or two from far-off Labuan.
</p>
<p><i>August 21st.</i>&#x2014;Our buffalo had wandered from her moorings during the night, and so we lost some
time in finding her. She was brought in at last, however, and we prepared to start
on our way. &#x201c;Beuhan,&#x201d; the headman here, had been very hospitable to us, first in setting
aside a good clean house for us, and he also gave our men rice and fruit, as their
supplies, like our own, were very small. Indeed, the fellow seemed so pleased to have
us at his village, and behaved so well to us, that I felt bound to make him a fair
repayment. I found out from &#x201c;Suong&#x201d; that &#x201c;Lapayang&#x201d; had told him of the musket which
Mr. Veitch and myself had given to him, and that &#x201c;Beuhan&#x201d; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296">296</a>]</span>wanted one too. I was glad to have the power of thus easily satisfying him. When I
handed the musket to him before all his people and told him always to help the white
men who came to him, he was visibly delighted, and looked at the glistening barrel
and bright brass-work with rapture. I also gave him a small supply of ammunition.
He had heard of my shooting down cocoanuts from the trees, both at Koung and at Kiau,
and he desired me to do this at his village. Smith handed me his rifle, and luckily
for my reputation, I smashed the particular nut he pointed out to atoms. Here, at
this village I took leave of my old friend &#x201c;Kurow,&#x201d; and gave his little daughter a
Chinese looking-glass, which pleased her greatly. Another little girl also from Kiau
was with her, and she looked so sorry that she had not one too, although pleased at
her friend&#x2019;s good fortune, that I could not but hand her one also, and her dusky face
was all sunshine in an instant. These two girls had walked all the way from Kiau yesterday
perfectly barefoot over rough ground, rocks, streams, and jungle, carrying heavy loads,
while &#x201c;Kurow&#x201d; carried only his slender-shafted spear. It is this hard work at an early
age which so soon destroys the lithe figures and tiny hands and feet these Dusun children
so often possess.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Beuhan&#x201d; sent two men with us as guides to Sineroup. This was a great gain to us,
as they knew the road well, and conducted us by what I may call the &#x201c;overland route,&#x201d;
that is, by the <span class="corr" id="xd29e3152" title="Source: hill paths">hill-paths</span>, and in this way we avoided three or four of the worst crossings. We found the walking
very rough and fatiguing, especially in the close gullies we had now and then to cross.
About ten o&#x2019;clock we reached the village of Bundoo on the opposite hill, and here,
while awaiting our men, I sketched the top crags of the great mountain, of which we
obtained an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297">297</a>]</span>excellent view, and also made a sketch of some Dusun tombstones on the little village
green. While waiting, a woman brought us two young cocoanuts and put them down before
us, so that we might drink, which we were glad to do, as it was very hot to-day. We
gave her a looking-glass, which she evidently considered a good price for her fruit.
I found these Tampassuk Dusun far more inclined to be hospitable than their brethren
of the Tawaran.
</p>
<p>We passed several tiny hill villages to-day, and some of them had a neat bamboo-fence
and a stile at the entrance with notched sticks for steps. Some of the houses are
surrounded by luxuriant gardens, each of which contains kaladi, Indian corn, a castor-oil
plant (<i lang="la">Ricinus</i>) or two, cotton bushes, and in each there is invariably a clump of cocoanut trees,
and three or four slender-stemmed betel-nut palms, while here and there old stumps
are verdant with the betel pepper, the leaves of which are chewed along with bits
of betel-nut, and a few condiments, such as lime&#x2014;made from coral reef or shells&#x2014;and
gambier. Here and there, too, the red-fruited rose-apple or jambosa was seen. We reached
Sineroup about 3.30, and singularly enough have not had a drop of rain all day. &#x201c;Gantang,&#x201d;
the Orang Kaya, was glad to see us, and pointed with pride to the new garments he
wore, made from the cloth he had earned by accompanying us to Kiau.
</p>

</div><p>
</p>
<p><i>August 22nd.</i>&#x2014;We left Sineroup and its hospitable headman this morning, after having arranged with
him for a guide and another buffalo as far as Ghinambaur. We descended the hill, and
after crossing the river two or three times, which was easily done now, since no rain
had fallen yesterday, we were surprised by meeting a young Labuan man&#x2014;whom I had formerly
employed. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298">298</a>]</span>was a handsome young fellow named &#x201c;Sallia,&#x201d; a relative of poor old Musa, and from
him I heard that Mr. Pretyman, accompanied by Mr. Dobree, a Ceylon coffee planter,
were following, and that their object was to proceed to &#x201c;Kina Balu&#x201d; in search of land
suitable for coffee culture. A few minutes later we met them and had luncheon together
on the dry stones of an old river course. In answer to Mr. Dobree&#x2019;s inquiries I told
him what I had seen of the country, of the large extent either actually under cultivation
by the Dusun or lying fallow as jungle, and that virgin soil in large tracts would
only <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299">299</a>]</span>be obtainable by felling the primæval forests on the enormous spurs of Kina Balu itself.
We parted just as a heavy shower came on, and pursued our way to Ghinambaur, which
place we reached about four o&#x2019;clock, drenched to the skin and covered with mud to
our waists, the roads being in a frightful state owing to the rain. We sought our
old quarters, and soon made ourselves comfortable for the night. We heard that a court-house
was being built here by Mr. Pretyman, but did not see it, and inquiries as to what
the &#x201c;white man&#x201d; was going to do were numerous, as indeed they had been all along our
route.
</p>
<p>After resting, I could not resist making the accompanying sketch of the great mountain
as it loomed up through the cloud strata just before sunset. We were four days&#x2019; journey
from its base, and yet it seemed so very nigh to us in the last hours of sunlight
as to appear only a mile or two distant through the sun-lit air of evening.
</p>
<p><i>August 23rd.</i>&#x2014;We started early this morning from Ghinambaur, having a walk of fifteen miles before
us over wretched roads ere we arrived at Mr. Pretyman&#x2019;s residence, &#x201c;Port Alfred,&#x201d;
on the Tampassuk. My buffalo was nearly knocked up, and so I left her in charge of
the men, and I and Smith, trusting to our knowledge of the way, pushed on ahead. We
had a hard day&#x2019;s work a greater part of the way, floundering about in the mud of buffalo
tracks, or crossing streams and creeks up to our necks, with just such a suspicion
of lurking alligators being in them as made the thing exciting. I stayed at one place
to collect palm-seeds, and the roots of a dwarf zingiberaceous plant, bearing pretty
little white and lilac flowers. Here and there in the jungle we also saw a large amorphophallus,
bearing erect spikes of red berries, and a pale-leaved variety of banana had its leaves
beautifully blotched with reddish purple. In one place we had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300">300</a>]</span>to cross a grassy plain, the mud and water being up to our waist-belts in places,
and the tall coarse grasses arched over our heads so that for a mile or more one has
to flounder up this grassy sewer, the effluvia from the festering mud and the heat
being alike almost unbearable. We at last reached the low sandstone hills and padi
fields near the Badjow village, and were glad to know that we were within a mile or
two of our destination. Then came another case of floundering through a wet rice field
in a drenching shower, up to the knees in unctuous black mud, remarkably warm, too,
it felt to the legs and feet. After all our struggles, however, we reached the Residency
about four o&#x2019;clock, dirty, wet, and tired. Here we found M. Peltzer in charge, although
looking very pale and ill. We found out that he was suffering from low fever and dysentery,
although fortunately not in anything like its worst phases. A bath and clean dry clothes
was the first thing, after which we were glad to sit and rest ourselves ere dinner
time. We discovered that our friend, M. Peltzer, had formerly studied in the Horto-Agricultural
College, founded by the late M. Van Houtte, at Ghent, and that he had come here to
make experiments in the culture of tapioca, tobacco, and other kinds of tropical produce.
He related to us an account of a journey made into the interior as far as Sineroup,
in the course of which he had lost three buffaloes in the streams. Altogether we passed
a very pleasant evening, glad to be so near the termination of a long, and at this
time of the year, a very critical journey. The accommodation here was luxurious to
what we had been accustomed to, and in spite of mosquitoes we slept the sleep of the
thoroughly weary.
</p>
<p><i>August 24th.</i>&#x2014;We arose soon after 5 a.m., and calling our followers, bade them prepare our boat
for the homeward <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301">301</a>]</span>voyage. We ourselves looked after the welfare of our plants, and packed up our roots
and seeds carefully. A party of men were sent to the sandstone hills to procure roots
of the white gardenia before alluded to. At 7.50 we obtained a beautiful view of the
mountain, the top crags, ridges, and water-falls being very distinct in the clear
morning sunlight. I could not resist sitting down on the verandah and sketching the
scene. Although my sketch was true as regards outline, nothing but colour could represent
anything of the beauty of this scene&#x2014;it is a subject worthy of Walton&#x2019;s skill and
labour. The tints of light are ever changing in the morning&#x2019;s sun, and the cloud strata
lie like downy pillows on the bosom of a giant. No wonder the simple Dusun, gazing
on this mountain in all the radiance of its early morning glory, has idealised it
as the heaven of his race!
</p>
<p>A small herd of water-buffaloes have come down to the opposite side of the river to
drink, and I was surprised to see that most of them had short stumpy tails. On inquiry
I am told that the Badjows cut the tails of their riding buffaloes, otherwise they
draggle in the mud and dirty water so common here, and then besprinkle the clothing
of their masters. The poor beasts must feel their loss sadly in a hot country where
mosquitoes and other blood-sucking flies are abundant, but as we cut our sheep&#x2019;s tails
short without so good a reason, we must not be the first in this case to throw a stone.
</p>
<p>We gave all our men a rest this afternoon, which they sadly needed, for several of
them were nearly exhausted. About four o&#x2019;clock we were surprised at the return of
Mr. Dobree and Mr. Pretyman, who had proceeded no further than the hill just above
Sineroup. The Chinese cook of course received orders to augment his food supply, and
we spent a very agreeable evening. Mr. Dobree <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302">302</a>]</span>showed us the skin of a young rhinoceros which he had shot in the mud pool near the
Sagaliad river, about twenty miles from Sandakan. The lower horn was three inches
in length, the upper one only just growing. Mr. Pretyman had also a small but very
interesting collection of large coleoptera caught in the immediate neighbourhood.
</p>
<p><i>August 25th.</i>&#x2014;We finished rigging up our boat this morning, and stowed all our plants and stores
on board before breakfast. Four of my men, including &#x201c;Suong,&#x201d; who had been very useful
to me, agreed to stay at this place as policemen under Mr. Pretyman. To oblige him
I allowed them to do this. About 1 p.m. we stalled down the river, a much easier thing
than pulling the other way. We reached the mouth in about an hour, but could not get
over the bar, as there was not a foot of water on the bar; indeed we saw two native
fishermen carry their little canoes over. We had to wait until 10 o&#x2019;clock at night,
when we got over and out to sea with a favourable breeze, but we did not reach Labuan
until August 30th, since we had contrary winds, and altogether a very rough passage.
</p>
<p>Thus ended our journey for the second time to &#x201c;Kina Balu,&#x201d; which occupied in all thirty-one
days from Labuan, of which thirteen were occupied in the sea voyage from Labuan to
the Tampassuk and back; from Tampassuk to Kiau and back thirteen; and from Kiau to
the mountain and back five days. Our last journey, viz., the Tawaran from Gaya and
Menkabong, occupied in all twenty-three days, but as we happened to start just at
the commencement of the dry season, we avoided the dangers and difficulties of fording
rapid streams. In the dry season the Tampassuk route could be accomplished in five
days, and the ground is much more level than that along the Tawaran route, which is
both hilly and fatiguing, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303">303</a>]</span>track being almost impassable for buffaloes. The difference in the time occupied by
the two routes is in part accounted for in this way. Thus when I and Mr. Veitch went
by the Tawaran we saved four or five days in going by chartering a passage for ourselves
by a trading steamer which landed us at Gaya Bay the next morning after leaving Labuan.
On our reaching Labuan, poor Smith, who had been ill in the boat for two or three
days, had to go to the hospital with a very bad attack of fever, doubtless contracted
during our walk from Ghinambaur to the Tampassuk. He fortunately recovered in a week&#x2019;s
time, but evidently had felt the effects of a difficult mountain journey. All our
friends in Labuan were glad to see us back again, and the mails from home which had
arrived during my absence were of the most cheering kind. Notwithstanding our rough
passage I found my plants and seeds in good condition, and I am glad to know that
the practical results of this journey were more encouraging than I had expected, and
many of the plants and seeds obtained ultimately reached Chelsea alive. Having at
this time been over a year in Borneo, I had learned a good deal of the language, and
had also found much to admire in the Malays and aboriginals, so that I felt in a way
loath to leave a land which had been fraught with so many novelties and adventures
to me.

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The forests and gardens of Borneo are remarkably rich in native and naturalised kinds
of edible fruits, and the forests especially may be considered as the home of the
mangosteen, durian, tarippe or trap-fruit, langsat, rambutan, and jintawan, all excellent,
indeed unapproachable, in their way, but if one would enjoy them a journey to the
East is unfortunately necessary. They are somewhat like our own luscious jargonelle
pears or green gage plums, and must in a sense be &#x201c;eaten off the tree.&#x201d; The mango,
one of the finest and most variable of Eastern fruits, has been successfully cultivated
in the West Indian Islands, St. Michael&#x2019;s, and Madeira, and has fruited out-of-doors
at Lisbon, but those we have named above have hitherto resisted culture outside their
own restricted habitats, if we except the solitary instance in which the mangosteen
fruited in one of the hothouses at Sion House some years <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305">305</a>]</span>ago, and the trees introduced to the island of Ceylon, which have succeeded fairly
well. Another extremely useful and variable fruit, the banana, is quite commonly ripened
in our gardens, and with the pine-apple these may be accounted the only tropical fruits
which lend themselves to anything approaching a regular system of successful culture
in our hothouses at home. Our ordinary cultivated fruits are naturally found in temperate
or inter-tropical countries&#x2014;Europe or the cooler parts of Asia principally; and of
all those cultivated in the open air of Southern Europe, such as the vine, fig, and
orange, the latter is the only one which can be induced to prosper in the tropical
lowlands of the far East, where its evergreen character enables it to hold its own
while its deciduous neighbours seem to fail through over-excitement, the loss of their
customary winter&#x2019;s sleep.
</p>
<p>On the other hand the pine-apple of South America, the mango of India, and the delicious
little Chinese or mandarin orange, here luxuriate in the open air, the mango yielding
two crops in twelve months, while fruit of the others may be obtained all the year
round. In some favoured districts in Malaya the forests almost become orchards on
a large scale, so plentifully are they stocked with durian, baloona, mambangan, varieties
of tampoe, luing, and other native fruits, in addition to those already named; and
in many places the pine-apple is so abundantly naturalised as an escape from cultivation
that one might almost be led to imagine it indigenous did we not know that, together
with the white guava, the papaw, and cashew-nut&#x2014;a trio forming the &#x201c;weeds&#x201d; among tropical
fruits&#x2014;it is a native of the western tropics. So abundant are the crops in some seasons
that one cannot help regretting their perishable nature, by reason of which their
shipment to Europe in a fresh state is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306">306</a>]</span>prevented; and as to their preservation in the form of candied confections or &#x201c;jam&#x201d;
no one seems to have taken up the matter. Fancy a conserve of snowy mangosteen pulp,
preserved mangoes, candied rambutan, or banana marmalade. The late Dr. Lindley once
said, in his usual incisive way, that &#x201c;most tropical fruits were edible,&#x201d; but that
&#x201c;very few were worth eating;&#x201d; but then the probability is he had never tasted a mango
or a mangosteen, a tarippe fruit, or the deliciously rich apricot-like pulp which
surrounds the seeds of the caoutchouc-yielding willughbeias, and certainly not a durian.
</p>
<p>The mangoes, oranges, bananas, pomoloes, and pine-apples are all cultivated fruits
in the East, just as are our best gooseberries, strawberries, apples, pears, and grapes
at home; but on the other hand we have no wild fruits which can in any way be compared
with the durian, jintawan, langsat, trap, <span class="corr" id="xd29e3223" title="Source: tamp&#x153;">tampoe</span>, mangosteen, and rambutan, all of which are more truly wild in the Malay islands
than are the so-called wild cherries, gooseberries, currants, and raspberries of our
woods. It is to the tropics one must go for a drink of fresh cocoanut milk&#x2014;a taste
of the fascinating durian, for a luscious mango, or the delicious mangosteen; and
while in the matter of flowers our cultivators at home certainly have the advantage,
in the case of fruits this much can scarcely be said.
</p>
<p>The regal durian (<i lang="la">Durio zibethinus</i>), like the finest of nectarines or melting pears, must be eaten fresh and just at
one particular point of ripeness, and then it is, as many think, a fruit fit for a
king. So highly is this vegetable-custard valued that as much as a dollar each is
not unfrequently paid for fine specimens of the first fruits of the durian crop brought
into the Eastern markets. It is a universal favourite both with Malays and Chinese,
but the opinions of Europeans vary as to the merits of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307">307</a>]</span>this &#x201c;delectable epitome of all that is perfect in fruit food.&#x201d; It is a paradox, &#x201c;the
best of fruits with the worst of characters,&#x201d; and, as the Malays say, you may enjoy
the durian, but you should never speak of it outside your own dwelling. Its odour&#x2014;one
scarcely feels justified in using the word &#x201c;perfume&#x201d;&#x2014;is so potent, so vague, but withal
so insinuating, that it can scarcely be tolerated inside the house. Indeed Nature
here seems to have gone a little aside to disgust us with a fruit which is perhaps
of all others the most fascinating to the palate, when once one has &#x201c;broken the ice,&#x201d;
as represented by the foul odour at first presented to that most critical of all organs
of sense, the nose. As a matter of course, it is never brought to table in the usual
way, and yet the chances are that whoever is lucky enough to taste a good fruit of
it to begin with, soon <span class="corr" id="xd29e3233" title="Source: developes">develops</span> into a surreptitious durian eater; just as a jungle tiger becomes a &#x201c;man-eater&#x201d; after
its first taste of human blood.
</p>
<p>There is scarcely any limit to durian eating if you once begin it; it grows on one
like opium smoking, or other acquired tastes; but on the other hand, the very suggestion
of eating such an &#x201c;unchaste fruit&#x201d; is to many as intolerable as the thoughts alone
of supping off cheese and spring onions, washed down with &#x201c;stout and mild,&#x201d; followed
by a whiff from a short &#x201c;dudeen&#x201d; by way of dessert, and yet, while these incongruities
are consumed at home with enjoyment, one must not be too hard on those abroad who
relish the fragrant durian. About the middle or end of July durian fruit are very
common in Singapore, and their spiny skins lie about the streets in all directions.
As you pass along you become aware of a peculiar odour all around you&#x2014;an odour like
that of a putrid sewer when half suppressed by holding a perfumed handkerchief to
the nose&#x2014;a blending of a good deal that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308">308</a>]</span>is nasty with a <i>soupçon</i> of something rather sweet and nice. On opening a fruit for yourself, however, you
find that the perfume, like that of the musk plant, ceases to be evident after you
have once had a fair whiff at it at close quarters. The flavour of the straw-coloured,
custard-like pulp which surrounds the four or five rows of large chestnut-like seeds
is perfectly unique: to taste it, as Wallace tells us, is &#x201c;a new sensation, worth
a journey to the East to experience;&#x201d; but much depends on a good fruit being obtained
when perfectly, not over ripe. You then find the pulp sweet, rich, and satisfying;
it is indeed a new sensation, but no two persons can agree as to the flavour&#x2014;no two
descriptions of it are alike. Its subtle action upon the palate&#x2014;and perhaps this best
explains the unceasing popularity it enjoys&#x2014;is like the music of a well-played violin
on the ear, rich, soothing, sweet, piquant. The flavour of durian is satisfying, but
it never cloys; the richness seems counteracted by a delicate acidity, the want of
grape-like juiciness is supplied by the moist creamy softness of the pulp as it melts
away ice-like on your tongue.
</p>
<p>It is said that the best of whisky is that made by blending several good kinds together,
and Nature seems to have blended four or five good flavours together when she made
the durian. &#x201c;A <i lang="fr">macédoine</i> of fruits,&#x201d; says a modern author, &#x201c;when well made and judiciously flavoured, is a
delicious sweetmeat. The grape, the peach, the apricot, and the pine, meet in welcome
harmony; the pear, the apple, and the cherry, and their friendly companionship, and
all these opposing elements of flavour are blended with a soft and soothing syrup.&#x201d;
In a word, the durian is a natural <i lang="fr">macédoine</i>&#x2014;one of Dame Nature&#x2019;s &#x201c;made dishes&#x201d;&#x2014;and if it be possible for you to imagine the flavour
of a combination of corn flour and rotten <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309">309</a>]</span>cheese, nectarines, crushed filberts, a dash of pine-apple, a spoonful of old dry
sherry, thick cream, apricot-pulp, and a <i>soupçon</i> of garlic, all reduced to the consistency of a rich custard, you have a glimmering
idea of the durian, but, as before pointed out, the odour is almost unmentionable&#x2014;perfectly
indescribable, except it be as &#x201c;the fruit with the fragrant stink!&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The fruit itself is in size as large as a Cadiz melon, and the leathery skin is protected
by sharp broad-based spines very similar to those of a horse chestnut. The name durian,
in fact, is derived from these&#x2014;the word <i>duri</i> in Malay meaning a spine or thorn. There are many varieties in the Bornean woods,
some but little larger than horse chestnut fruits, and having only two seeds; others
larger, but with stiff orange-red pulp, not at all nice to eat, however hungry you
may be; and even the large kinds, with creamy pulp and many seeds, vary very much
in flavour. The trees are monarchs of the forest, as a rule varying from seventy to
one hundred and fifty feet, or even more, in height, with tall straight boles and
spreading tops, and the foliage is oblong acuminate, dark green above, paler and covered
with rufous stellate hairs or scales below. The fruits of the finer varieties fall
when ripe, and accidents sometimes happen.
</p>
<p>I saw a native who had the flesh torn from his shoulder by a blow from one of these
armed fruits, and saw several narrow escapes, but personally I gave the trees a wide
berth at fruiting time. Some varieties, especially the &#x201c;durianburong,&#x201d; or wild-bird
durians, do not shed the fruits, which hang on the branches until the valves open,
when the seeds fall to the ground, or are eaten by hornbills and other large fruit-eating
birds and monkeys. I saw some magnificent specimens of durian trees in the Bornean
forests north of the capital, and also in other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310">310</a>]</span>Malayan islands, where the forests had been cleared for cultivation, and these trees
left standing for the sake of their produce. Their clusters of large white flowers
are produced about April, and form a great attraction to an enormous species of semi-diurnal
bat, a kind which is said to be one of the greatest pests of Eastern fruit-groves.
It is from cultivated trees that the finest of fruits are obtained; and, without exception,
the best fruits I ever saw or tasted were from a tree in the grounds of Government
House, Labuan. It does well in Sumatra, Java, Celebes, and the Spice Islands, and
even as far north as Mindanao. Forests of it exist on the Malay peninsula, and very
fine fruit is brought to Singapore from Siam about July or August. On the coast of
the Bay of Bengal it grows as far north as Tenasserim, in lat. 14° N., but it does
not succeed well in India, and cannot be grown in the West Indies. In Sumatra groves
of this tree exist near the Palembang River, and in the primæval forests there are
specimens fully 150 feet in height, the fruits being in perfection about September
and October; but two crops are produced each year, and throughout the Archipelago
one finds its seasons of ripening to be very various.
</p>
<p>There are many different varieties, doubtless the result of promiscuous seeding, or,
perchance, cross-fertilisation, and one variety actually produces flowers and fruit
on its exposed roots.
</p>
<p>Of all Eastern fruits the mangosteen is perhaps the general favourite with Europeans,
and of all fruits it is one of the most delicious and refreshing. It flourishes in
nearly all the islands from the south coast of Java to Mindanao, the most southern
of the Philippine group, and on the mainland it flourishes as far as Bangkok, and
in the interior to 16° N., but on the coast of the Bay <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311">311</a>]</span>of Bengal only to 14° N. Attempts to cultivate it in India have failed, and in Ceylon
success is only partial. In the West Indies all attempts to grow it have proved abortive.
In Borneo trees are not uncommon in the forests, but the fruits generally are below
the average size, the divisions within are fewer&#x2014;rarely more than four&#x2014;and each segment
of pulp contains a fully developed seed. When cultivated in richly-manured gardens
or orchards, however, as in Penang or Singapore, not only are the fruits larger and
the carpellary divisions more numerous, but rarely more than one perfect seed is found
in each fruit, the remaining segments consisting of edible pulp only. Similar effects
may be observed in the case of the rambi and duku, or langsat fruits, and the best
of cultivated mangoes are remarkable for their thin and comparatively small stones,
while the edible part on the other hand is much augmented. Under cultivation the mangosteen
forms a low round or conical-headed tree, its dark leathery evergreen foliage reminding
one of that of the Portugal laurel, only that it is of a bolder character. The waxy-petaled
flowers are borne near the extremities of the branches, and are succeeded by round
fruits, which, when fully ripe are as large as a medium-sized orange. On cutting the
leathery dark purple rind transversely about the middle of the fruit, it is found
to be of a port-wine colour in section, and encloses from three to six segments of
snow-white pulp, cool and refreshing to the taste, and with a flavour which is something
like that of the finest nectarine, but with a dash of strawberry and pine-apple added.
It is one of the very few tropical fruits of which even delicate invalids may eat
with advantage; and the dried rind, when infused in boiling-water and drank as tea,
forms an astringent which has been proved serviceable in dysentery after all other
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312">312</a>]</span>medicines had failed. It is the general native remedy for this disease throughout
the Malay Islands, and the dried skins strung on strips of rattan are commonly met
with in the bazaars.
</p>
<p>When exploring near the capital city of Brunei in North West Borneo I frequently came
across a species of garcinia&#x2014;sometimes in flower, sometimes in fruit&#x2014;which my native
followers called &#x201c;Prada Prada,&#x201d; the duplication of particular names being usual in
Borneo, for the sake of emphasis, as also among various native tribes in South America
and elsewhere. The foliage and flowers are somewhat like those of the mangosteen proper,
the fruit, however, is curiously shaped like a boy&#x2019;s &#x201c;top,&#x201d; and of a bright red colour,
changing to purplish black when fully ripe. The segments of edible white pulp are
usually eight in number&#x2014;four containing fully developed seeds, and four are abortive
or seedless&#x2014;the flavour being similar to that of the mangosteen proper, but more acidulous.
</p>
<p>Of the luscious mango, Rumphius tells us that it was introduced by the Dutch from
the Moluccas to Java in 1655, but it grows in India, and as the Malay name and that
of the Javanese as applied to this fruit are evident corruptions of that in the Sanskrit
tongue, Mr. Crawfurd thinks that it was brought to the Archipelago from the Continent,
and that it should not be considered as indigenous. Be this as it may there is no
doubt that the mango has long been introduced to the Malay Islands, in many of which
it is now perfectly naturalised, and a fruit exactly like the mango in structure is
often found in the Bornean woods. It has the mango flavour of the most ultra tow and
turpentine type, but its juice is very grateful during hot weather, as I can testify
by experience. The cultivated mango forms a round-headed evergreen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313">313</a>]</span>tree, rarely over fifty feet in height, and generally not much more than half that
size. The old leaves are of a deep green colour, but the young growth is often of
a bright red or crimson tint. The dense clusters of pea-green flowers are followed
by lax-drooping clusters of kidney-shaped fruits which, when fully developed, vary
from two or three to as much as six inches in length, and nearly half that in diameter
in the broadest part. These fruits consist of a tough green skin and a coat of yellow
pulp surrounding an oblong fibre-coated stone, to which the flesh adheres. In the
Sulu isles the mango is abundantly naturalised, some of the trees being of large size.
In Indian gardens the best kinds are perpetuated and increased by grafting, and this
is also the case in Manilla, where the best varieties are equal, if not superior,
to those of Bombay, the excellence of which is well nigh proverbial throughout the
East. This tree is of robust constitution and regularly produces two crops every year,
although at times the crops are very scanty, owing to heavy rains during the flowering
season.
</p>
<p>It is one of the Eastern fruits the culture of which is moderately successful in the
gardens of the West&#x2014;notably in Jamaica, and very fair samples of this fruit from the
West Indies now and then make their appearance in Covent Garden from the Azores. The
mango, like its more fastidious neighbour the durian, is one of Nature&#x2019;s voluptuous
productions, of which we have no representative in our gardens, although, so far us
the mango is concerned, it might be cultivated successfully in our hothouses with
but little more trouble and expense than that which attends the culture of pine-apples
or bananas. There are varieties which fruit freely when only five or six feet high,
and when only three or four years old; the greatest difficulty in the matter would
be to secure the right sorts, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314">314</a>]</span>which possibly might be had from Madeira, or even St. Michael&#x2019;s, where fair crops
are obtained when the seasons are propitious, and even in Europe proper fruits have
been produced in the open air. This was in 1874 at Necessidades, near Lisbon, the
residence of the King of Portugal, the tree&#x2014;a dwarf one&#x2014;bearing nine fruits about
the size of ducks&#x2019; eggs.
</p>
<p>Of varieties there is literally no end, a result doubtless brought about by indiscriminate
propagation from seed. Some are small with tough skins, large stones, and fibrous
pulp, with a strong turpentine-like flavour. Others are large, with thin stones, the
skin being tender and the thick pulp quite soft, like that of a real Beurré pear,
the flavour being most luscious and delicate, without a trace of the turpentine-and-tow-like
combination so marked in the case of inferior kinds. The flavours of the different
fine varieties are most varied, much more so than in the case of our best pears, and
two or three good mangoes before breakfast form a treat sure to be appreciated by
a lover of good fruit, and much as I appreciate a good durian, the mango seems to
me a far more delicious and refreshing fruit for general consumption under a hot sun.
</p>
<p>The rambutan is a common fruit in Singapore, and is the produce of a pinnate-leaved
tree, thirty to fifty feet in height, the hairy fruits being borne in clusters near
the extremities of the branches. On the husk being removed the edible pulp is seen
surrounding the solitary seed, and is of a white jelly-like consistency, with a brisk
and refreshing sub-acid flavour. There are several varieties. The common one has a
red outer husk, but there are yellow and purple skinned varieties of excellent flavour.
The Malay name, &#x201c;boi rambutan,&#x201d; or hairy fruit, refers to the soft, thick hairs on
the outer husk. Two other species grown in China afford fruits of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315">315</a>]</span>a similar character, which, dried, are sometimes met with in this country under the
name of &#x201c;litchis.&#x201d; The fruit is common in gardens or orchards throughout the Malay
islands, and is quite wild in Borneo.
</p>
<p>In Batavia it ripens in February and March, and is common in the streets of Singapore
during July and August. In the forests of North-West Borneo it ripens in September,
large basketsful of it being collected by the natives and brought in along with tampoe
fruit, and occasionally mangosteen and fine durian. A basketful of this fruit at first
sight reminds one of strawberries, it being singularly like them in size and colour.
</p>
<p>The bread-fruit tree is frequently met with, but the fruit is not so much used by
the Malays as it is by the natives of the South Sea Islands. Another member of the
same group, the &#x201c;nangka,&#x201d; or <span class="corr" id="xd29e3287" title="Source: Jack fruit">Jack-fruit</span>, is much more generally grown, and produces immense fruits, varying from ten to seventy-five
pounds weight. Like the bread-fruit, it has a rough netted coating, the portion eaten
being the golden pulp which surrounds the seeds. A smaller fruited, and altogether
more delicate flavoured species, affords the &#x201c;champada,&#x201d; and the habit of the tree
is much like the <span class="corr" id="xd29e3290" title="Source: Jack fruit">Jack-fruit</span>, but the &#x201c;champada&#x201d; may be recognised by its leaves being hairy below, those of the
<span class="corr" id="xd29e3293" title="Source: Jack fruits">Jack-fruits</span> being smooth and glossy on both surfaces. This kind is liked both by Malays and Europeans.
</p>
<p>The &#x201c;tarippe,&#x201d; or &#x201c;trap,&#x201d; is another allied fruit borne by a round-headed tree, having
entire leaves much larger than the last, and hispid on both surfaces. They are also
of a pale, rusty-green tint, and the fruits are borne near the extremities of the
spreading branches, as in the bread-fruit, and not produced from the main branches
or the bole of the tree, as in the case of the <span class="corr" id="xd29e3298" title="Source: Jack fruits">Jack-fruits</span> and &#x201c;champada.&#x201d; This is the most palatable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316">316</a>]</span>of all the bread-fruits, so far as my own experience goes, the pulp which surrounds
the seeds being of a milk-white colour, and very soft and juicy. The husk consists
of closely packed hispid spikes, pressed closely together, and amalgamated at the
base around the pulp-coated seeds. In North-West Borneo this fruit is in perfection
during August and September, and it is particularly abundant around the Dusun villages
near Kina Balu.
</p>
<p>The leathery coated seeds of all these species of bread-fruits are roasted and eaten
by the natives in much the same way as are chestnuts here at home. All the species
have india-rubber yielding tendencies, and their inner bark is tough and useful for
various purposes.
</p>
<p>The &#x201c;jintawan,&#x201d; or &#x201c;manoongan&#x201d; fruit, of which there are three kinds, is about the
size of an orange, and very similar in colour, each containing from eight to twelve
pulp-covered seeds.
</p>
<p>The &#x201c;tampoe,&#x201d; or &#x201c;tampui,&#x201d; is another very common jungle fruit, of which but little
appears to be known. There are three varieties&#x2014;&#x201c;tampoe shelou,&#x201d; &#x201c;tampoe putih,&#x201d; and
&#x201c;tampoe baraja.&#x201d; The two first named differ in the one having yellow pulp and the
other white. The last is a smaller fruit, having four internal divisions instead of
six, and the pulp is of a bright chestnut colour. The part eaten is the pulp surrounding
the seeds, which is agreeably sub-acid and very refreshing, the pavia-like husks,
and the seed themselves, being discarded. The tree is fifty or sixty feet in height,
with dark green poplar-like leaves, and the fruits hang two or three together in lax
clusters, the stalks being produced from the older branches. This fruit is eaten in
large quantities by the natives; and the pulp mixed with rice and water, and afterwards
fermented, affords them an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317">317</a>]</span>intoxicating drink but little inferior to the &#x201c;toddy&#x201d; prepared from the cocoanut palm.
</p>
<p>A fruit closely resembling the common &#x201c;bilimbing&#x201d; is found in the Lawas district,
and is called &#x201c;tampui bilimbing&#x201d; by the natives. It is of a bright scarlet colour;
and according to the native account it has large entire leaves, the fruits being borne
on short few-flowered peduncles, which proceed from the main branches of the tree.
The white pulp which surrounds the solitary seed is acidulous and pleasant.
</p>
<p>Another jungle fruit, called &#x201c;mandaroit&#x201d; by the Kadyans, resembles a small &#x201c;rambutan,&#x201d;
but the leathery husk is quite smooth. It may possibly be produced by a species of
niphelium, and is very sweet and agreeable when perfectly ripe, the fruits being kidney-shaped,
and but little larger than a blackbird&#x2019;s egg.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Rambeneer,&#x201d; a still smaller, pale yellowish-green fruit, also has sweet flesh around
a stone; but in this case the husk is mango-like, having a thin and tender skin, which
may be eaten with the pulp.
</p>
<p>The fruit known to the natives as &#x201c;mamhangan&#x201d; is as large as an ostrich&#x2019;s egg, having
a rough, brown skin, and when ripe the yellow flesh which surrounds a mango-like stone
is rather agreeable as a juicy sub-acid accompaniment to a dish of plain boiled rice.
</p>
<p>The &#x201c;luing&#x201d; is another edible fruit, but rarely seen even in its native woods. It
is yellow, with brown markings, and rarely exceeds a pigeon&#x2019;s egg in size. After the
thick, leathery husk is removed, one finds a delicate white sub-acid pulp surrounding
a small stone. It is rather viscid, with a slight flavour of turpentine. The albumen
of the seed is similar to that of a nutmeg.
</p>
<p>After the durian, one of the most esteemed of native <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318">318</a>]</span>fruits is, undoubtedly, the &#x201c;langsat,&#x201d; which is of a pale yellow or straw-colour,
borne in short clusters of four or five together, on a somewhat fastigiate pinnate-leaved
tree. The individual fruits are as large as pigeon&#x2019;s eggs, the part eaten being the
four or five segments of white gelatinous pulp within a tough, leathery husk. Of these
rarely more than one contains a solitary seed, which, if tasted by accident, is found
to be remarkably bitter. The seedless segments are always sweeter and more palatable
than the others&#x2014;indeed, this is the case generally, as exemplified in the mangosteen
and rambi. In Singapore this fruit is known under the name of &#x201c;duku.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The &#x201c;rambi,&#x201d; when plucked from the stalk, is singularly like the langsat in shape,
colour, and flavour. The tree, however, is more dwarf, having large entire leaves,
and the fruits are borne in ropes of ten or fifteen together, on long drooping stalks.
The covering of the fruit is straw-coloured, and tough like that of the langsat, but
there are only three segments of pulp in each. The best I ever tasted came from the
garden of the British Consulate at Brunei, but I think the &#x201c;langsat&#x201d; is preferable
in point of flavour. The latter is very commonly seen in groves near the villages
of the inland tribes; the &#x201c;rambi,&#x201d; on the other hand, is much less abundant, and I
never met with it except in European gardens.
</p>
<p>The &#x201c;mangalin&#x201d; of the Kadyans is a fruit very similar in general structure to the
&#x201c;jintawan,&#x201d; and consists of ten or twelve pulp-covered seeds enclosed in an orange-like
fleshy covering. The flavour is sweet, with a sub-acid after-taste.
</p>
<p>The fruits of two kinds of jambosa, or rose-apples, are met with, but like the papaw,
cashew-nut, and the apple-fruited <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319">319</a>]</span>guava, they are not esteemed of much account in a country so rich in really delicious
kinds.
</p>
<p>The sweet melons grown in Borneo are very poor indeed, but good water-melons may now
and then be obtained, and are cool and refreshing in such a hot climate. All the members
of the orange family do well, especially the delicious little lime, which is perfectly
naturalised in many places, being with the dwarf bamboo one of the plants most commonly
used for hedges. No cooling drink can possibly surpass that formed by mixing the juice
of one of these deliciously perfumed limes in a tumbler of water with a little sugar,
and as they keep well they are most valuable to the traveller in hot countries. Common
oranges may be procured all the year round from gardens, as also may the small fruited
&#x201c;mandarin&#x201d; variety, which is a near approach to the tangierine orange, now and then
to be had in Covent Garden. It is rather a surprise to find that the oranges cultivated
in the tropics have grass-green skins when perfectly ripe, the vivid &#x201c;orange&#x201d; fruit
so familiar at home being there almost as great a rarity as a grass-green specimen
to us in England.
</p>
<p>Of all the orange tribe in the East, however, none can compare with the great-fruited
pomolo, which under careful cultivation here attains to a state of perfection elsewhere
unknown. The pomoloes, or shaddocks, brought to Covent Garden from the West Indian
Islands and the Azores, are flavourless as a turnip when compared with the pomoloes
of Bangkok or Labuan, or even with those of Northern China or Singapore. There are
many varieties, differing much in aroma and flavour, but all are referable to the
lemon-fleshed or pink-fleshed types; it is extremely difficult, however, to say which
type affords the best variety. A well-grown pomolo is nearly as large <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320">320</a>]</span>as a child&#x2019;s head, and unless its segments be very carefully divided when serving,
the copious grape-like juice which escapes will almost swamp any ordinary dessert-dish,
and the best sorts have quite a muscatelle-like flavour; and in addition to its other
good qualities it may, like the orange, be kept for a considerable time without injury&#x2014;so
long, indeed, that pomoloes are frequently brought home to England from the Chinese
ports in excellent condition. Two sorts of custard apples are commonly met with in
Eastern gardens, but neither these nor the apricot-like pulp of the ubiquitous papaw
are much esteemed where far better fruits are plentiful. The same remark applies to
the &#x201c;santoel&#x201d; fruit, which externally resembles a wizened yellow-fleshed American
peach, but it contains four stones surrounded by white sub-acid granular pulp, which
clings to the stone as in mangosteen or rambutan. The tamarind is naturalised near
villages and houses in many of the Eastern islands, its acid pulp being used in cookery,
and by pouring boiling water over the pulp, and adding a squeeze of lime juice and
a little sugar, a most refreshing fever-drink may be made.
</p>
<p>Of palms the cocoanut is most plentiful, and of course the most generally useful.
Its top, or heart, may be used as a delicious vegetable equal to asparagus, and the
scraped albumen yields the milk so essential to blend or soften a well-made curry.
The colourless water in the fresh young nuts is peculiarly valuable and grateful as
a beverage, preferable where drinking water is in <span class="corr" id="xd29e3333" title="Source: anyway">any way</span> questionable; cocoa-nut oil being, moreover, one of the most valuable of Eastern
palm products. The fruit of the &#x201c;pinang,&#x201d; or betel-nut palm is as essential to the
Malay races as tobacco to our own, and even the fruit of the nipa, or &#x201c;thatch&#x201d; palm
may be eaten. The astringent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321">321</a>]</span>pulp which surrounds the seeds of several species of &#x201c;rattan&#x201d; palms is occasionally
eaten for medicinal purposes. Perhaps one of the most singular of all wild fruits,
however, is the &#x201c;Bawang utan,&#x201d; or wild onion fruit, which is not unlike a walnut in
general appearance, but which is impregnated with such a decided alliaceous principle
that a small portion of it grated forms an excellent substitute for the real esculent
itself. Scientifically it is known as <i lang="la">Scorodoprasum borneense</i>. The foliage and branches of this tree when broken or bruised give off a strong alliaceous
odour.

</div><p>
</p>
<p>Last on my list, but by no means least amongst the tropical fruits of Eastern gardens
comes the &#x201c;pisang,&#x201d; or banana, which here, as elsewhere wherever it is cultivated,
is represented by many varieties, which differ in size of fruit, flavour, and other
particulars. One of the most common varieties met with in the bazaars is &#x201c;pisang amas,&#x201d;
or golden banana, the individual fruits of which are small, but of a bright golden
colour and of excellent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322">322</a>]</span>flavour. One of the most esteemed of all is &#x201c;pisang rajah,&#x201d; or king of bananas, a
larger fruit, also of a deep golden colour, the flavour being very luscious. &#x201c;Pisang
hijau,&#x201d; the green banana, is slender and angular, but the straw-coloured pulp is of
a most exquisite flavour, and it is quite a favourite in Singapore, where the &#x201c;rajah&#x201d;
variety is comparatively scarce. &#x201c;Pisang kling&#x201d; is a pale yellow kind, bearing large
smooth fruits, and for eating with cheese this is one of the best, being less sweet
than those just named. A large horned variety of banana is common in Borneo, called
of the natives &#x201c;pisang tandock,&#x201d; the individual fruits being a foot long and two inches
in diameter. The outer skin is green, changing to yellow when fully ripe, and this
fruit is liked by those who do not relish the sweeter kinds.
</p>
<p>These fruits are largely eaten by natives, and they may be cooked in a variety of
ways. Banana fritters is a common Eastern dish, and stewed bananas in syrup are accounted
delicious by lovers of sweet things, and pisang kling is really a nice substitute
for bread when eaten with cheese.

bridges, hotels, and Europeans, may be excused if he feels a little anxious when called
upon to make an expedition which will require several weeks to accomplish on foot,
and during which time nearly all necessaries must be carried by the party <i>en route</i>. A party of say twenty natives will require a clear head to manage it rightly, and
it is only by maintaining a system that the thing can be conveniently done. The main
points to be considered may be tabulated thus:&#x2014;

</p>
<p>Health is best preserved by regular habits, taking care to avoid chills by wearing
flannel next to the skin, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324">324</a>]</span>great care should be taken to put on dry clothes the first thing after a halt is made
for the night. One may be drenched to the skin in the tropics without any harm ensuing
if this precaution is taken. Belts of soft flannel worn around the stomach are very
comfortable, and are highly recommended by many medical men. All your clothing should
be light, and if of flannel so much the better. A flannel shirt and tweed trowsers
secured by a belt and a light pith helmet, woollen socks, and a light pair of English
walking boots cannot be improved upon as a travelling costume. A small knapsack or
bag should be carried containing a clean dry jersey, shirts, socks, sarong, and light
shoes; you are then independent of your baggage-bearers, who will often linger miles
behind yourself and guides. When a fire is made at night, have all your clothes dried
so as to be ready for the following evening. To preserve them from wet in crossing
rivers, etc., fold them into as small a compass as possible, and envelope them tightly
in waterproof cloth. The old coverings as removed from bales of Manchester goods are
very useful for this purpose. A couple of pairs of flannel <span class="corr" id="xd29e3386" title="Source: panjamas">pajamas</span> may be taken for sleeping in. Three changes of travelling clothes will be sufficient,
this gives one suit on, one being washed, and one suit dry and clean. For bedding
take a waterproof sheet, a drab rug, and a red blanket. Light brushwood or palm leaves
will make a good substitute for a mattress. If shelter is not obtainable and the ground
is wet, a light net-hammock becomes useful, a roof to it being readily made with the
waterproof sheet. Take soap and a comb.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Food</span> is of the utmost importance. Rice, biscuits, and oatmeal may form the staple, and
tinned soups, Liebig&#x2019;s extract of meat, and dried fish may be added. Chocolate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325">325</a>]</span>and milk in sealed tins is convenient and refreshing. Tea, coffee, sugar, and salt
must be packed in well-corked bottles to keep them dry and free from ants, etc. A
bottle of Yorkshire relish or Worcester sauce, and a tin or two of bloater paste are
nice relishes for soups. Fowls, eggs, fruit, and sometimes freshly-caught fish may
often be purchased <i>en route</i>. A supply of fresh limes is easily carried, and no better cooling and refreshing
drink can be made than that formed by squeezing a lime in a glass and adding water
and sugar. Be very careful of the water drunk in travelling, and use a pocket-filter
whenever it is in anyway doubtful. I always drank cocoanut water when procurable,
as being pure and harmless, and with a dash of brandy it is extremely refreshing.
As to the quantity of food required, two pounds of rice is ample for a man&#x2019;s daily
supply, and less will suffice at times, as natives are generally good foragers. It
is generally best, however, to pay less wages, and agree to find the men rice, otherwise
they will take only a small quantity, and when that is gone much time will be lost,
as they have an excuse for foraging. A few pounds of that universal vegetable, the
onion or garlic, should be taken for soup. Jam in tins is also very handy, and a treat
to eat with rice for a change. Each man of the party should receive his daily supply
of rice every morning, and in order to facilitate progress, all cooking for the first
morning&#x2019;s meal may be done overnight.
</p>
<p>Cooking should be well understood by all who propose to &#x201c;rough it&#x201d; in a wild land,
and it may be defined as the art of preparing food so that it is&#x2014;1, nutritious; 2,
tasty; 3, nice to the eye. Two cook-pots are necessary&#x2014;one large enough to boil a
fowl when cut up, and the other for rice. A frying-pan and a few pounds of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326">326</a>]</span>flour render you independent of the baker, and with oatmeal oat-cakes may be indulged
in. Put a few currants in your boiled rice now and then for a change. Most Madras,
and some Chinese &#x201c;boys&#x201d; are good hands at a curry, and if you give them a share of
it when made they are encouraged to excel. A favourite jungle-dish of my own was a
fowl cut up and boiled with two onions, a handful of rice, salt and pepper, and thin
slices of gourds, sweet potatoes or other vegetables, and three or four small chilies;
when it was nearly done, a small tin of soup&#x2014;julienne or ox-tail&#x2014;was added. Oatmeal
forms a nice change from boiled rice, and biscuits are a treat, as also are sweet
potatoes nicely boiled, or corn cobs, yams, or kaladi roasted in the embers. Tinned
soups are much improved by having fresh vegetables boiled in them, such as palm cabbages,
sweet potatoes, or cucumbers. Eggs may be eaten boiled, poached, or beaten up in a
cup of tea or coffee, in which case the yelk only should be used. A nutritious drink
is made by beating up the yelk of a fresh egg with a squeeze of lime, a little sugar,
whisky, or gin and water. If a dash of Angostura bitters be added, so much the better.
Native cook-pots may always be borrowed, or on occasion biscuit or soup-tins form
good substitutes. If pressed for supplies, corn cobs or &#x201c;mealies&#x201d; form a good substitute
for bread, and may be varied now and then with bananas or sweet potatoes. Bananas
may be eaten with cheese. The nebong (<i lang="la">Oncosperma</i>) palm, generally common beside the Malay rivers, affords a tender &#x201c;cabbage,&#x201d; with
a delicate asparagus-like flavour. Pigeons are generally plentiful, and in extreme
cases even monkeys may be &#x201c;potted.&#x201d; On boating expeditions a baited hook should always
be towed astern. Most natives understand the style of fishing, and best bait to use.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327">327</a>]</span></p>
<p>Packing is important. Rice should be made up into small parcels of 10 lb. each, and
wrapped in waterproof sheeting, as if it gets wet it soon turns sour, unless spread
out in the sun to dry. Oatmeal should be baked in an oven, and then packed in dry
bottles or tins. Biscuits should be bought in 2 lb. tins. All clothes, books, and
other damageable articles should be enveloped in waterproof sheeting. In giving the
stores to the carriers, put down the man&#x2019;s name and the stores he carries in a book,
so that they may be readily found when wanted. Aneroids, thermometers, &amp;c., should
be fitted into japanned tin cases, which may be covered with leather. If tightly fitted
into leather cases, they are liable to become damaged, as the leather contracts on
becoming wet.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Bathing.</span>&#x2014;Always bathe in the morning. Care must be taken not to frequent alligator-infested
streams. Whenever there is any doubt, never enter a stream, but bale up the water
and pour it over the body. Nearly all Eastern people bath in this way, and one is
not so liable to become inordinately chilled as by plunging into a large body of cold
water. Never bathe at night when tired or feverish. At such times a towel-bath is
sufficient if the thing is really needful. Dip a towel in water, and wring it partly
dry, and then rub the body briskly and quickly all over. The dipping and wringing
process may be repeated as desired, then finish with a clean dry towel. A good way
of securing a refreshing bath where water is a long way off, or limited in quantity,
is to send for some in a common wine or spirit bottle, in which it is handy for pouring
over one&#x2019;s head and body, and a dry towel completes the work. When in vigorous health,
a good douche-bath in a cool hill or mountain stream is a great <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328">328</a>]</span>treat in a hot land, but it must be remembered that to bathe in this way when exhausted
or feverish is in the highest degree suicidal.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Medicines.</span>&#x2014;In nearly all towns and colonies good medical advice is obtainable, and, as a rule,
preferable to self-help. On long inland journeys, however, one must frequently trust
to one&#x2019;s own resources, and to secure a supply of medicines must be one of the traveller&#x2019;s
first cares. The three most useful of all medicines for travellers, prospectors, hunters,
or emigrants, are Cockle&#x2019;s pills, Collis Brown&#x2019;s chlorodyne, and Howard&#x2019;s sulphate
of quinine. These and a bottle of brandy must always be taken, together with a roll
of sticking-plaster, needles, silk thread, and a few long bandages. Cold compresses
are easily made of towels, and a bottle of mustard may be useful for poultices on
occasion. A small bottle of carbolic acid is useful for mixing with oil as a dressing
for mosquito bites, scratches, or other flesh-wounds. One part of acid to fifteen
or twenty parts of oil is a good proportion for ordinary use. All travellers, before
leaving the beaten track of civilisation, should acquire some knowledge of bone-setting.
The whole thing is easy, but nothing short of actual demonstrations can teach the
elements of the art. A broken limb in the forest a month&#x2019;s journey from professional
aid is a serious thing, and must always be regarded as a possibility. The only thing
to be done is to reach some shelter where a stay can be made, and then to get the
limb into position as near as possible like its uninjured fellow, and of the same
length. This question of length is most important&#x2014;in the leg especially&#x2014;or a limping
gait is sure to follow after the bones have united. Once in the right position, the
thing is to secure it with a splint and bandages. A <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329">329</a>]</span>heap of sand makes a capital cushion for the limb, and also helps to hold it in position.
Of course professional aid must be had if possible, and all whose business calls them
far from it should be wise enough to gain the knowledge requisite to preserve life
and limb as far as is possible without professional skill.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Modes of Travelling.</span>&#x2014;The only sure method of progression in a wild land is on foot; now and then ponies
or buffaloes are obtainable, and along the coast, or where there are rivers, journeys
may be wholly or partially made in native boats. In walking journeys, the first care
is boots. These, for hot climates, should be strong, and of English make, but light.
Woollen socks are softer and better suited to tender feet than cotton ones. Native
guides should be obtained from some one in authority, and passports are desirable,
if not actually essential. Buffaloes are often useful for riding, carrying heavy baggage
and rice, and for crossing rivers. For the latter service two or three good water-buffaloes,
accustomed as they are to the country and fords, are invaluable. Get a good buffalo-driver.
In crossing rapid fords, keep the buffalo&#x2019;s head to the current, and take him well
up stream, so as to allow for the force of the current, or you will find yourself
below the ford, and perhaps in deep water, ere the opposite bank is reached. Ponies
are best for riding (a saddle should be taken out from Europe), but are not as a rule
so useful for river crossing as water-buffaloes. Nearly all coast natives are good
sailors, and accustomed to make long boat journeys. Every traveller, however, should
understand how to sail a boat for himself. A compass is useful for bearings either
in boats or for forest travel, where it is often difficult to see the sun.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330">330</a>]</span></p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Shelter.</span>&#x2014;A light tent of oiled calico is often useful, as timbers for it can be cut almost
anywhere <i>en route</i>. A waterproof sheet will protect you from ground-damp if spread on brush-fern or
palm-leaves. In the Malay islands the natives are very clever at constructing huts
or tabernacles of palm-leaves, &amp;c., but wherever there are native houses one is always
welcome to the large public room, firewood, and water. Field-huts, overhanging rocks,
and caves, have sometimes to be taken advantage of. I have slept very comfortably
many nights in the open forest in a light net hammock swung between two trees, with
a waterproof sheet put roof-fashion as a protection from the rain. It is often difficult
to light a fire. I used to carry a few dry sticks, and when a fire had to be lighted,
I whittled these into shavings with my knife. These light readily as a rule. A small
bottle of spirits of wine may be carried, as paper soaked in it will set fire to almost
anything. I have seen the Borneans wet paper with cocoanut-oil, or mix whittled shavings
with melted beeswax in order to get a fire. If the matches are damp, tinder may be
made by blowing a piece of rag or paper out of a gun. A small spirit-lamp cooking
apparatus, if well and strongly made, is a great convenience to a traveller, enabling
him to get his coffee, chocolate, or a refreshing cup of tea while the men are rigging
up shelter, or lighting a camp-fire.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Barter.</span>&#x2014;There are not many countries wherein it is now necessary to carry goods for barter.
In the interior of the Malay islands, and in the far interior or mountainous districts
of other countries, however, it still happens that money is useless. White or grey
shirting and chopper blades are generally acceptable throughout the interior of Borneo
and the Sulu islands. Black and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331">331</a>]</span>red cloth, looking-glasses and knives, are also valued; needles and thread are currency
for small trifles inland in nearly all wild lands. Muskets and ammunition are also
often highly prized. The best goods for barter with natives, and all information,
may generally be obtained from the bazaars in the coast towns. Whatever you take let
it be good of its kind, and always remember that necessaries are more valued than
beads and other ornaments. Tobacco is often highly valued, even by people who cultivate
their own, as in Sulu.

<p>All goods for barter should be so packed that any article may be brought out for examination
without exposing the remainder. The more goods the natives perceive you to have the
higher will they value their own edibles or services. Beads, Birmingham jewellery,
&amp;c., may be taken for presents or for small payments.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Arms.</span>&#x2014;The strength of right and gentleness is the best of all protections for the traveller
anywhere, and in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332">332</a>]</span>any case the moral force of firearms is generally sufficient. A good revolver is always
a source of interest and amusement (perhaps sometimes of awe) to uncivilised people,
and a good double breech-loading shot-gun is really useful, besides affording some
amusement to the traveller who obtains food or natural history specimens thereby.
Where there are wild pigs, deer, elephant, or other large game, a rifle is of service,
and a Winchester repeater is both handy and effective, weighing about 10 lb. A shot-gun
is the most useful, however, of all weapons, and if fitted with ball or No. 1 shot
cartridges is very effective at short ranges with deer, wild cattle, or pigs. It should
be of what is called No. 12 bore, as cartridges of that size may be bought nearly
everywhere, where ammunition is sold.
</p>
<p>If we except the Sarawak principality and the Dutch possessions to the southward and
eastward, Borneo may be called a perfectly wild country&#x2014;a land where laws, jails,
horses, roads, and missionaries are unknown. The future prospects of this tropical
island, so rich in natural products, so fertile under rude cultivation, and withal
so extensive and beautiful, are deserving of more than a passing notice. A large proportion
of the country is hilly, and covered with old forest. Near the coast the land is generally
well watered by shallow rivers. On the higher hill ranges which lie a few miles inland
from the north-west coast, the climate, which is in the plains sultry and malarious,
becomes fresh and salubrious. The natives are few in proportion to the area, and generally
peaceably disposed towards strangers, but suspicious of ulterior motives, and remarkably
cautious, and <span class="corr" id="xd29e3534" title="Source: now then">now and then</span> avaricious in matters of trade and barter. They invariably prefer sound useful articles,
such as white or black cloth, to ornamental gewgaws.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333">333</a>]</span></p>
<p>The products of the island may be tabulated as follows:&#x2014;

<p>The vegetable products are mostly indigenous, and obtainable in the primæval forests.
Some few, however, such as cotton, tobacco, coffee, and cocoa have been introduced,
and are only cultivated by the natives in a desultory manner. Under systematic culture,
and with Chinese coolie labour, nearly all the vegetable products of tropical countries
might be grown.
</p>
<p>The mineral products are known to exist, but it is not as yet determined whether the
lodes are workable, or if the metals exist in remunerative quantities. A great drawback
to mining operations is the enormous rainfall. The want of British protection, and
the difficulties of travel or transit inland, are against colonisation. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334">334</a>]</span>river Kinabatangan opens up the country from the north-east coast, and affords a good
water-way by which produce could be brought down to the coast; but nearly all the
other rivers to the north-west, as far as Brunei, are shallow and unnavigable, except
for a mile or two near the sea; the roads inland being mere buffalo tracks, and extremely
irregular on the hill slopes.
</p>
<p>The highest land and coolest climate in the island is on Kina Balu (altitude 13,700
feet), a large mountain about five days&#x2019; journey from the mouth of the Tampassuk river.
The lower slopes of this range might possibly grow good coffee; cinchona would be
more likely to succeed in the cool and fresh, but humid, climate of the large spurs.
The land here is in places deep and rich with forest <i>débris</i>. In places good red land, with belts of luxuriant bamboo amongst the sandstone boulders,
was seen. In estimating the richness of the soil, the growth of a particular species
of ginger common everywhere was observed, on poor soils it rarely exceeded a foot
in height, but on some of the hill slopes near Kina Balu it attains a height of six
or eight feet.
</p>
<p>The bamboo is also here more luxuriant than I observed it elsewhere in the island,
and the greater variety and luxuriance of undergrowth shows that the climate or soil,
or both, are here better than near the coast. There are rich alluvial deposits on
the plains, where wet rice, tapioca, sago, and fruits and vegetables generally, grow
well. Dry or hill rice, and the cocoanut palm, succeed inland up to 3,000 feet elevation.
</p>
<p>In Sarawak land culture has not proved to be so remunerative as the antimony and gold
mines; in the north, however, this order of things might possibly be reversed. An
English company has been formed for the purpose of colonising the northern part of
the island, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335">335</a>]</span>and the cessions obtained comprise the whole northern portion from Kimanis on the
north-west coast to Sabuco on the east, the total area being computed at 20,000 square
miles.
</p>
<p>It seems to me, however, that Borneo is too far from the great highway of eastern
commerce to attract any but the most sanguine of planters and capitalists. I saw very
good land in Jahore on Gunong Puloi, and recent explorations in Perak by Mr. Murton
of Singapore (as also by practical coffee planters from Ceylon, and tobacco growers
from Province Wellesley) prove that, so far as soil and climate are concerned, Perak,
Quedah, and Jahore offer equal advantages for land culture, besides being much nearer
to Singapore and the great sea-way between England and the East.

<p>The main object of my journey eastward was the collection and introduction of beautiful
new plants to the Veitchian Collection at Chelsea. Botanical specimens were obtained
and preserved whenever practicable, as also were birds and other objects of natural
history. I was fortunate in adding about fifty new species of ferns to the lists of
those already collected in Borneo, and of this number, as will be seen from the following
report, about twenty were absolutely new to science. Perhaps the greatest good fortune
which attended my exertions was the introduction alive of the Giant Pitcher Plant
of Kina Balu (<i lang="la">Nepenthes Rajah</i>, Hook. f.). This wonderful plant and its geographical allies were discovered in 1851
by Hugh Low, Esq., C.M.G., and were figured and described by Sir Joseph D. Hooker,
<abbr title="Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India">K.C.S.I.</abbr>, in Vol. xxii. of the <i>Transactions</i> of the Linnæan Society. Mr. Low made repeated journeys to Kina Balu from Labuan,
but unfortunately failed in his endeavours to introduce these fine plants to European
gardens in a living state. Mr. Thos. Lobb, one of the most successful of all Eastern
plant hunters, attempted to reach the habitat of these plants in 1856, but was prevented
by the natives. These plants are very remarkable, and, so far as is at present known,
exist only on this one mountain in Borneo.

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341">341</a>]</span></p>
<p><i lang="la">Nepenthes bicalcarata</i>, the &#x201c;Two-spurred Pitcher Plant,&#x201d; was also for the first time introduced alive, and
is very remarkable, its pitchers being armed in a really formidable way, and the swollen
stalks of its urns are perforated by a species of ant in a singular manner.

</div><p>
</p>
<p>Of palms a beautiful species of areca, having gracefully arched leaves and vermilion-coloured
sheaths, was introduced alive, as also a very attractive dwarf species of pinanga
(<i lang="la">P. Veitchii</i>, H. Wend.), the bifurcate fans of which are purple below and glaucous-green above,
blotched with brown. Aroids are plentiful in the shady Bornean forests, the species
in some cases being extremely local in their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342">342</a>]</span>distribution. Of the new genera discovered two have very pretty spathes, and if they
can be successfully cultivated will prove very interesting and ornamental stove plants.
<i lang="la">Piptospatha insignis</i>, N.&nbsp;E. Br., a pretty little &#x201c;rock arad,&#x201d; found on sandstone boulders in the beds
of mountain streams, has a tuft of lance-shaped leaves and dainty white spathes tipped
with pink. <i lang="la">Gamagyne Burbidgei</i>, N.&nbsp;E. Br., is a plant of larger growth, being a foot high but otherwise of similar
habit. The spathes are of a bright rose colour. This plant grows beside mountain streams
in positions where the passing water laves its roots.
</p>
<p>Amongst new species of aroideæ may be mentioned the sub-aquatic <i lang="la">Cryptocoryne caudata</i>, N.&nbsp;E. Br., which has heart-shaped bullate leaves of a dark green colour, the spathe
being terminated with a long tail, which reminds one of the same appendages in the
arisæmas of the Himalayas. Three or four new species of alocasia were found, the remarkable
being <i lang="la">A. scabriuscula</i>, <i lang="la">A. guttata</i>, and <i lang="la">A. pumila</i>. <i lang="la">Pothos ceratocaulis</i>, a fresh green climbing species, was also introduced alive, and is a plant of distinct
marcgraavia-like habit. Specimens of <i lang="la">Schismatoglottis</i> and <i lang="la">Chamæcladon</i> are at present undetermined. A singular new asclepiadaceous genus (<i lang="la">Astrostruma spartioides</i>, Benth.), was discovered growing as an epiphyte on forest trees in Labuan, and in
dry woods near the sea at the northern point of the last-named island, the remarkable
little <i lang="la">Microstylis Burbidgei</i>, Rchb. f., was found. One of my first discoveries in Borneo itself was the new zingiberaceous
genus <i lang="la">Burbidgea</i> (<i lang="la">B. nitida</i>, Hook, f.), and other novelties were <i lang="la">Dendrobium cerinum</i>, <i lang="la">Cypripedium Lawrencianum</i>, and <i lang="la">Bolbophyllum Leysianum</i>, a highly curious plant. A fine new <i lang="la">Bolbophyllum</i> was introduced alive to Chelsea from the Tampassuk river (<i lang="la">B. Petreianum</i>, Burb. MS.), which I propose shall bear <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343">343</a>]</span>the name of my whilom travelling companion, P.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;M. Veitch, Esq.
</p>
<p><i lang="la">Rhododendron stenophyllum</i>, and <i lang="la">Nepenthes Burbidgei</i>, Hook. f., were two of the more remarkable of the new plants from Kina Balu itself,
where also the gigantic moss <i lang="la">Dawsonia superba</i> was collected at an altitude of 6,000 feet, these specimens being, as Mr. Mitten
informs me, the first obtained northwards of New Zealand,
</p>
<p>The three native courts of Jahore, Brunei, and Sulu were visited, and I was enabled
to make extended excursions into the interior of the main island of Sulu itself. In
Borneo the flora was remarkable for endemic Malasian species, intermixed more especially
at high altitudes with Indian (<i lang="la">Rhododendra</i>) and Australian (<i lang="la">Dacrydium</i>, <i lang="la">Phyllocladus</i>, <i lang="la">Drosera</i>, etc.) types. In Sulu both the flora and fauna showed, as was to be expected, a marked
resemblance to those of the Philippine and Celebes groups. My collections in Sulu
comprised new ferns, rare mosses, and several beautiful new orchids, including <i lang="la">Phalænopsis Marie</i>, <i lang="la">Dendrobium Burbidgei</i> (which is mainly remarkable as being similar to the <i lang="la">D. d&#x2019;Albertisii</i> discovered about the same time in New Guinea). Here also the lovely pink-blossomed
<i lang="la">Aerides Burbidgei</i>, Rchb. f., was obtained, and several other species and varieties at present unnamed.
</p>
<p>The Sulu voyage was in many ways enjoyable, but especially as being to a virgin land
botanically and ornithologically, and I must here take the opportunity of acknowledging
my obligations to Captain W.&nbsp;C. Cowie, of the steamship <i>Far East</i>, who gave me every accommodation during the voyage from Labuan, and while we lay
in the little harbour at Meimbong. As will be seen, my ornithological discoveries
in Sulu were a new species of jungle cock (<i lang="la">Gallus stramineicollis</i>), and a new paroquet (<i lang="la">Tanygnanthus <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344">344</a>]</span>Burbidgei</i>). <i lang="la">Sarcops Lowii</i> was also obtained in Sulu, and the new <i lang="la">Buchanga stigmatops</i> from Kina Balu. No special endeavours were made in obtaining birds, only such species
being shot as came in the way while I was searching the forest and mountain sides
for plants.
</p>
<p>The first expedition to the great mountain of Kina Balu was made in company with P.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;M.
Veitch, Esq., who joined me on his return from an extended tour in Australia and the
Fiji islands. The journey was a critical and tedious one, as we walked every inch
of the way from Gaya Bay to the mountain, and back again to the coast, <i>viâ</i> the Koung, Kalawat and Bawang villages. We were successful in finding all the large
species of nepenthes in one locality on the mountain for the first time, and in addition
a distinct variety of <i lang="la">N. Edwardsiana</i> with shorter thick-winged pitchers, which it is possible may prove to be a natural
hybrid between <i lang="la">N. Edwardsiana</i> and <i lang="la">N. villosa</i>.
</p>
<p>My acknowledgments are due to Hugh Low, Esq., C.M.G., H.M. Resident in Perak, who,
when he heard of my intention of ascending the mountain, very kindly sent me information
as to the localities on Kina Balu where the nepenthes and other rare plants are found.
To H.&nbsp;E. William Hood Treacher, H.M. Administrator of Labuan, and to the Hon. Dr.
Leys, M.B., Colonial Surgeon of the same island, I shall always be grateful for the
practical help afforded me during my expedition, and for the open-handed hospitality
they extended to a wandering stranger by chance thrown in their way.

<p>It will be seen that altogether Mr. Burbidge has added above fifty species to the
fern-flora of the island. His exploration <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350">350</a>]</span>quite bears out the idea that we previously entertained, that the fern-flora of the
island is very rich, and that there is still a plentiful harvest to await the exploration
of the interior. The added species which are not new are nearly all already known
in Java and the Philippine Islands, frequently in both.

<p>The Sulu Archipelago is a group of small islands lying between Borneo and the Philippines.
They are for the most part under cultivation; but there are two mountains which attain
an elevation of between two thousand and three thousand feet. So far as I am aware
their botany is entirely unknown. The following is a full catalogue of the ferns which
Mr. Burbidge gathered in the group:&#x2014;

<p class="xd29e164">[<i>Received March 18, 1879.</i>]
</p>
<p>The present collection was formed by Mr. F.&nbsp;W. Burbidge during a short stay in the
Sulu Islands, a most interesting locality to the ornithologist, and one of which very
little is known. In my paper on Dr. Steere&#x2019;s collections from the Philippines, I noticed
the four species of birds as yet recorded from the Sulu Islands,<a class="noteref" id="xd29e5354src" href="#xd29e5354">1</a> and I ought to have added the common <i lang="la">Artamus</i> of the Indo-Malayan region, and a cuckoo, both recorded by Peale from Mangsi.
</p>
<p>In addition to the birds obtained by Mr. Burbidge, I have received permission from
the authorities of the Oxford Museum to describe the large Bornean collections forwarded
to that institution by Mr. W.&nbsp;H. Treacher, Acting Governor of Labuan. Amongst them
are a few birds from Sulu, but apparently not the result of a separate expedition,
but presented to Mr. Treacher by Mr. Burbidge. To the latter gentleman I am indebted
for the following notes:&#x2014;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Among the birds which I saw in Sulu, but could not secure, I would particularly mention&#x2014;some
hornbills, seemingly the common black-and-white small kind from Lab&#x16b;an; a fine white
harrier, with black tips to the wings (this is a distinct and handsome bird, not unfrequently
seen circling over rice fields, or grassy plains); the &#x2018;fire-backed&#x2019; pheasant; and
an owl, apparently a larger and brighter-coloured edition of our common barn-owl,
or screeching species. The blue, white-ringed kingfisher (<i lang="la">Halcyon chloris</i>) of Lab&#x16b;an is very common here, as is also the rufous, white-headed scavenger hawk
or eagle;<a class="noteref" id="xd29e5372src" href="#xd29e5372">2</a> and at least two other species, both larger, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353">353</a>]</span>are to be found looking out for food near the wharf at Meimbong. Curlews are as plentiful
here as in Sarawak and other parts of Borneo. I missed the nocturnal &#x2018;chuck-chuck&#x2019;
of the goat-sucker, so common in Lab&#x16b;an. Water-rails and a pretty blue kingfisher
are not uncommon by the margin of the Meimbong river, which is close to the harbour,
and is an excellent shooting-ground. Gun-boats often come here; and as the country
is now readily accessible, much might doubtless be done in ornithology. Capital angling
may be had in this little river; and there is a good bathing place near the town,
and close to the market, where one may be entirely free from the fear of an alligator
lurking about in wait for a meal. Now and then the Sultan and his court, male and
female, together with all the principal people in the island, meet to enjoy the fun
of pig-hunting, the wild boar being very plentiful here, together with two or three
species of deer. These pigs do a good deal of damage to cultivated crops; so that
now and then a regular field-day is organised, and nearly every man, pony, dog, and
spear in the island are out, <i>versus</i> &#x2018;Piggy,&#x2019; as many as fifty of the latter being slain in a single day. There are so
many kinds of sport easily attainable here, provisions of the best are so cheap, a
pony may be hired for about 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day, and there is so much that is novel to be seen about the town and the court,
that the wonder is that some traveller, fond of sport, and especially ornithology,
does not take up his quarters here for a month or two&#x2014;and particularly as the place
is easily reached from Singapore, <i>viâ</i> Lab&#x16b;an, or from Hong-Kong, <i>viâ</i> Manila.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Mr. Burbidge left England on a botanical expedition, to collect living plants; and
his success in this department of natural history is well known. His chief attention
having been devoted to plants, it only remains to thank him for the intelligent way
in which he devoted his scanty leisure time to forming the present collection of birds.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>The following I believe to be a correct list of Sulu birds as at present known; and
I have included the few species mentioned by Peale as procured in Mangsi by the United
States <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354">354</a>]</span>Exploring Expedition. I have also added the references to Lord Tweeddale&#x2019;s recent
papers on the Philippine collections of Mr. Alfred Everett, and have given the ranges
of the different species in the Philippine archipelago, so as to bring the subject
up to the present date.

<p>A single specimen, collected by Mr. Burbidge, and exactly resembling the specimens
from Manilla and from Palawan in the British Museum.
</p>
<p>[Luzon (<i>Meyer</i>); Guimaras (<i>Meyer</i>); Negros (<i>L.&nbsp;C. Layard, Steere, Everett</i>); Cebu (<i>Everett</i>); Leyte (<i>Everett</i>); Mindanao (<i>Steere, Everett</i>); Malanipa (<i>Murray</i>); Sulu (<i>Burbidge, Peale</i>); Palawan (<i>Steere, Everett</i>).]

<p>4. <span class="sc">Tanygnathus burbidgei</span>, sp. n.
</p>
<p><i>Similis</i> T. muelleri, <i>ex Celebes, sed dorso toto sordide prasino, capite flavicanti-viridi et alis omnino
viridibus distinguendus</i>.
</p>
<p>This fine new species of <i>Tanygnathus</i> is closely allied to <i>T. muelleri</i> of Celebes and <i>T. everetti</i> of Mindanao. It differs from <i>T. muelleri</i> in having the back green instead of yellow, while the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355">355</a>]</span>head is yellowish green and not emerald-green; there is also no blue on the wing-coverts,
the whole wing being green.
</p>
<p>The following is a full description of the bird.
</p>
<p><i>Adult.</i> General colour above dark grass-green, including the hind neck, entire mantle, and
scapulars; wings a little lighter green, the wing-coverts and secondaries with narrow
yellow margins, the primaries blackish on the inner web, externally dark grass-green
with a slight blue shade along the shaft, the first primary black shaded with blue
on the outer web; entire <span class="corr" id="xd29e5525" title="Source: black">back</span> and rump deep cobalt-blue; upper tail-coverts green, slightly shaded with yellow
on the margins; tail-feathers dark green, with a narrow margin of yellow at the tip,
the under surface of the tail golden-yellow; head yellowish green, the sides of the
face also of this colour; the under-surface of the body bright grass-green, yellow
on the throat and fore neck and passing into green on the breast and abdomen; under
wing-coverts and under tail-coverts of the same green as the breast, with yellow margins;
quills ashy blackish below. Total length 15·5 inches, culmen 1·8, wing<a id="xd29e5528"></a> 8·6, tail 6·4, tarsus 0·65.
</p>
<p>On comparing <i>T. burbidgei</i> with <i>T. everetti</i>, one is struck at once by the larger size of the former and its yellowish green head,
the crown being emerald-green in <i>T. everetti</i>, which also has the wing only 7·55 inches in length (Samar: <i>Mus. Brit.</i>). None of the Sulu birds, of which there are five in the collections, have the feathers
of the mantle edged with blue as in the Samar individual.
</p>
<p>5. <span class="sc">Elanus hypoleucus</span>, Gould.

</p>
<p><i>Scops rufescens</i>, Sharpe, Cat. B. iii. p. 102.
</p>
<p>One specimen.
</p>
<p>This bird seems to me to differ slightly from Bornean and Malaccan examples in having
a much darker face, the ear-coverts shaded with black. I do not, however, propose
to found a new species on a single example, and must wait for more specimens. The
measurements of the Sulu bird are as follows:&#x2014;Total length 7 inches, culmen 0·7, wing
4·8, tail 2·6, tarsus 0·85. It will be seen that they are a good deal inferior to
those of the type of <i lang="la">Scops mantis</i>, as given by me in the &#x201c;Catalogue.&#x201d;

</p>
<p>This cuckoo may be <i>Cuculus himalayanus</i>, which has recently been shot in Labuan by Governor Ussher; but it is difficult to
decide without seeing a specimen. At present the species is only known from the plate
and description given by Peale, who procured it on the island of Mangsi.

1878, pp. 110, 285, 342, 380.
</p>
<p>The receipt of three more specimens from Mr. Burbidge convinces me that the Sulu Islands
bird, which I thought was a race of <i>O. frontalis</i>, Wall., from the Sula Islands, is not really specifically separable from the common
oriole of the Philippines, called by me <i>Oriolus chinensis</i>, and by Lord Tweeddale <i>Broderipus acrorhynchus</i>. A further comparison of the series seems to show that <i>O. frontalis</i> of Wallace, from the Sula Islands, is scarcely to be distinguished from <i>O. chinensis</i>, the only difference being the slightly greater extent of yellow on the tail-feathers
in the latter bird.

in the Ibis for 1872 (pl. vi.). On the other hand, it is very closely allied to <i>I. albigularis</i> of the Moluccas, but differs in the greyish shade on the white throat, which is also
more restricted, and in the forehead being grey with only a slight mark of lilac.

<p>Lord Tweeddale differs from Professor Schlegel&#x2019;s opinion that the same Philippine
species is found in Java and Lombock, where it is <i>M. emiliana</i> of Bonaparte; but having compared several specimens lately, I believe that the Professor&#x2019;s
view is the right one, and that the bird is found over the Philippines, and occurs
even in Borneo. Lord Tweeddale separates the Negros bird as <i>M. eurycerca</i>.

<p>20. <span class="sc">Gallus stramineicollis</span>, sp. n.
</p>
<p>General colour above black, shot with green and purple; wing-coverts like the back,

primary-coverts and primaries black, the secondaries externally green; feathers of
the lower back <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359">359</a>]</span>and rump straw-yellow, with darker longitudinal centres of black or green; upper tail-coverts
and tail glossy oil-green; crown of head and nape black; hind neck and neck-hackles,
as well as sides of neck, straw-yellow, deeper on the hind neck, with green longitudinal
centres to the feathers; remainder of under surface of body black with a green gloss;
comb short and rounded; sides of face and entire throat bare. Total length 34·5 inches,
culmen 1·1, wing 9·0, tail 17·5, tarsus 3·4.
</p>
<p>Mr. Burbidge procured a single example of this jungle-fowl, which appears to be a
very distinct species. He tells me that it was brought to the ship by one of the Sulu
natives alive, and he cannot vouch for its having been a wild bird. I have, however,
shown the bird to Mr. Gould and other ornithologists; and they agree with me that
it is probably a distinct species of <span class="corr" id="xd29e5945" title="Source: Jungle-fowl">jungle-fowl</span>. Governor Ussher also has seen the bird; and he tells me that he has never seen any
domesticated fowls in Borneo or the Eastern Islands which approached this species
in the least.

<p>The great mountain of Kina Balu has always been a locality of interest to the student
of Bornean ornithology; but I am not aware that any notes on the natural history of
this part of northern Borneo have ever been published. It gives me great pleasure,
therefore, to give a list of the specimens obtained by Mr. Treacher&#x2019;s collectors,<a class="noteref" id="xd29e5967src" href="#xd29e5967">1</a> and of a few others submitted to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360">360</a>]</span>me by Mr. Burbidge, and obtained during his recent expedition to this mountain. The
latter gentleman is well known from his successful botanical researches on Kina Balu;
and I shall shortly lay before the Society an account of some of his ornithological
discoveries in the Sulu archipelago.
</p>
<p>The present collection, though small, is of some importance; and the character of
some of the birds seems to show that the mountains of Borneo, when thoroughly explored,
will produce many species akin to those found in the mountains of Java, Sumatra, and
even of the Himalayas.

<p>The constant character of the long thin bill in specimens from N.W. Borneo impresses
me with the idea that Lord Tweeddale is right in keeping <i>C. tenuirostris</i> distinct from <i>C. enca</i>, with which I united it in my &#x201c;Catalogue of Birds&#x201d; (vol. iii. p. 43).

</p>
<p>The first occurrence of this species in Borneo was recorded by me in my list of Governor
Ussher&#x2019;s Sarawak collection; but it cannot be uncommon in North-western Borneo, to
judge from numerous specimens which have been sent from Labuan and from the opposite
coast by Governor Ussher and Mr. Treacher. Two specimens are contained in the collection
made on Kina Balu by Mr. Burbidge.
</p>
<p>9. <span class="sc">Chibia borneensis</span>, sp. n.
</p>
<p><i>C. similis</i> C. pectorali, <i>ex insulis Suluenisibus, sed plumis lanceolatis colli lateralis metallice chalybeo-viridibus
nec purpurascentibus, et maculis jugularibus et præpectoralibus valde minoribus et
conspicue metallicis chalybeo-viridibus distinguenda. Long. tot. 10, culm. 1·3, alæ
5·9, caudæ 4·5, tarsi 0·85.</i>
</p>
<p>An adult and young bird, in Mr. Treacher&#x2019;s collection.
</p>
<p>This is an interesting addition to the avifauna of Borneo, and seems to indicate an
entirely new species. It bears considerable resemblance to <i>C. bimaensis</i> of Timor and Lombock, but differs in having the long silky plumes on each side of
the lower back black instead of greyish white; while the Timor bird has not, like
<i>C. borneensis</i>, any long hair-like plumes on the head. On the other hand the latter character allies
it to <i>C. pectoralis</i> of the Sulu Islands; but it may be recognised on comparison by the much smaller and
more metallic spots on the throat and fore neck, which are steel-green, as also are
the neck-hackles. In <i>C. pectoralis</i> the spangles are large, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362">362</a>]</span>dull, and incline to purplish in tint. This species appears to me to be a thorough
<i>Chibia</i>, and I do not at present see how naturalists can avoid recognizing the existence
of <i>Chibia</i> in the Malay archipelago; nor do I understand how the Indian and Malayan species
are to be separated, when such a perfect gradation is now offered by <i>C. borneensis</i> and <i>C. pectoralis</i>. Under these circumstances I believe that Salvadori&#x2019;s genus <i>Dicruropsis</i>, which I was lately inclined to admit (Mittheil. k. zool. Mus. Dresd. iii. p. 360),
cannot be sustained; and I therefore revert to my old opinion concerning these birds
(Cat. B. iii. p. 234). I have given this species the name of <i>borneensis</i> to celebrate the addition of a <i>Chibia</i> to the avifauna of Borneo. Mr. Treacher has also procured a single specimen of it
on the Lawas river.
</p>
<p>The young bird from Kina Balu differs from the adult in being duller black, with fewer
and less metallic chest-spots and hackles.
</p>
<p>10. <span class="sc">Buchanga stigmatops</span>, sp. n.
</p>
<p lang="la">B. <i>similis</i> B. leucophææ, <i>sed macula lorali alba magna distinguenda. Long. tot. 10, culm. 0·9, alæ 5·3, caudæ
5·1, tarsi 0·7.</i>
</p>
<p>The presence of white on the facial region of a species of grey <i>Buchanga</i> would seem to ally it at once to <i>B. leucogenys</i>. In the Bornean bird, however, of which I have three specimens before me, the white
is confined to a large loral spot in front of the eye, whereas in <i>B. leucogenys</i> the eyebrow and ear-coverts, as well as the feathers below the eye, are also white
or whitish. The new species is also of the same dark grey as <i>B. leucophæa</i> (<i>B. cineracea</i> of my Catalogue, iii. p. 250), and not of the light pearly grey which is another
character of <i>B. leucogenys</i>. One specimen was contained in Mr. Burbidge&#x2019;s collection, and two in Mr. Treacher&#x2019;s.

</p>
<p>R. <i>similis</i> R. flaviventri, <i>sed multa minor et gula flava nec nigra <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363">363</a>]</span>distinguenda. Long. tota 5·7, culminis 0·5, alæ 3·1, caudæ 2·8, tarsi 0·7.</i>
</p>
<p>General colour above olive-yellowish, the wing-coverts like the back; quills and tail
dull blackish brown, externally washed with olive-yellow like the back, the greater
coverts also brown washed with olive-yellow; tail-feathers paler brown at the tip
of the inner web; head crested, black, as also the sides of the face, ear-coverts,
and cheeks; entire under surface of body yellow, slightly more olive-green on the
sides; under wing-coverts yellow, the longer ones white washed with yellow; quills
sepia-brown below, white along the edge of the inner webs.
</p>
<p>This species is almost exactly the same as <i>Rubigula atricapilla</i> of Ceylon, but has not the white tips to the tail-feathers, while its long crest
distinguishes it from the Ceylonese species, which is not crested. In the form of
the crest and in general appearance it is almost precisely similar to <i>R. flaviventris</i> of Pegu and Tenasserim, but is smaller, and has the throat yellow like the rest of
the under surface. The single specimen obtained was in Mr. Treacher&#x2019;s collection.
</p>
<p>14. <span class="sc">Criniger ruficrissus</span>, sp. n.
</p>
<p>C. <i>similis</i> C. gutturali, <i>sed supra ubique sordidior, supracaudalibus caudaque saturate rufescenti-brunneis;
loris et regione oculari cum genis et regione parotica sordide cinereis, gula alba,
corpore reliquo subtus sordide olivascente, sub caudalibus castaneis. Long. tot. 8,
culm. 0·85, alæ 4·0, caudæ 4·0, tarsi 0·7.</i>
</p>
<p>This species is not very different from <i>C. gutturalis</i>, but differs in its much darker coloration, especially on its under surface, which
is dull olivaceous, with a white throat and chestnut-red under tail-coverts. There
is an entire absence of the pale-brown colour of the breast washed with yellow, and
of the light yellow abdomen and pale fawn-coloured under tail-coverts. The crest is
very long in <i>C. ruficrissus</i>, and extends nearly to the mantle.
</p>
<p>15. <span class="sc">Ianthocincla treacheri</span>, sp. n.
</p>
<p>I. <i>similis</i> I. mitratæ (<i>S. Müll.</i>), <i>ex Sumatra, sed genis, mento et regione parotica sicut caput castaneis facile distinguenda.
Long. tota 10, culminis 0·85, alæ 4·15, caudæ 4·5, tarsi 1·5.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Adult.</i> General colour above dark ashy grey, with a very slight shade of ochraceous under
certain lights; the wing-coverts slightly more bluish grey than the back: quills blackish,
externally bluish <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364">364</a>]</span>grey, the primaries white along the basal part of the outer web, giving the wing a
conspicuous white outer aspect; tail-feathers dark slaty grey, shading into blackish
at the end of the feathers; entire crown and nape, as well as the sides of face, ear-coverts,
and fore part of cheeks deep chestnut-red, the under cheek-feathers slightly tipped
with ochraceous; frontal plumes with lanceolate tips of light ashy grey or hoary whitish;
under surface of body dull ochraceous brown, with lighter shaft-lines of pale ochraceous,
imparting a striped appearance to the throat and breast; the sides of the body more
ashy grey; chin chestnut, like the sides of the face; thighs dark grey, with a few
chestnut feathers near the tarsal bend; under tail-coverts chestnut; under wing-coverts
ashy grey, slightly marked with ochraceous; quills sepia-brown below, paler along
the edge of the inner web.
</p>
<p>Four specimens are sent by Mr. Treacher, all adult, and exactly similar in plumage.
On comparing them with Sumatran specimens of <i>I. mitrata</i>, a very marked difference presents itself, which shows that the Kina Balu bird belongs
to a new species. Although similar to <i>I. mitrata</i> in its general coloration and white-edged quills, it is distinguished at once by
its chestnut ear-coverts, while the chin and fore part of the cheeks are also chestnut.

<p class="xd29e6513">We were passed on by the Bedouins from kinsman to kinsman, and were everywhere received
as friends; nor is it too much to say that while in Arabia we enjoyed the singular
advantage of being accepted as members of an Arabian family. This gave us an unique
occasion of seeing and of understanding what we saw; and we have only ourselves to
blame if we did not turn it to very important profit.&#x2026; We are, I believe, the only
European travellers who have made the complete journey from Damascus to Häil, or from
Häil to Bagdad, while only two Europeans besides ourselves have visited Jebel Shammar
